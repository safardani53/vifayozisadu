But now that I’ve watched you, I think muscles are cool and I’m doing everything again,'" Graff told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Ninja Warrior Nation</a>.</p><p>"That’s the most heartwarming thing ever," she added. "To know that a kid was on the verge of losing their confidence and feeling like they couldn’t do what they love because of how it made them look and now she has that freedom and confidence to do what she loves doing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000738612750.jpg><h2>What happened to Jessie Graff?</h2><p>Graff injured herself during season 12 of American Ninja Warrior when she fell on the third obstacle on the final course.</p><p>After her fall, she needed surgery on her knee and shoulder and documented her progress on <a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p>The rehabilitation needed to get her back to 100 percent forced her to sit out of the season 13 competition.</p><p>In February 2021, Graff posted a video of her progress and announced she would not be competing in the upcoming season.</p><p>"Part of me keeps trying to calculate whether I can regain my strength in time, but the reality is that I won’t be fully healthy until a few months after qualifiers," she wrote.</p><p>"This time, I’m being smart and responsible, so I can heal fully and come back stronger than ever! This is just the first half of the song (and the story).</p><p>"But I’m so grateful for all the ways this time off has inspired me to learn and grow!

He said: "I swore my oath to the Crown and I did not relinquish my oath."</p><p>Jason Spelman, prosecuting, said that Goodall had "ordained himself" as a sworn special constable by reaffirming his oath after <a href=#>Charles III </a>became <a href=#>King</a>.</p><p>He said that this had no legal standing whatsoever and was something that Goodall had created.</p><p>Mr Spelman put to Goodall: "You refer to yourself as a special constable but you have no police uniform, you get no remuneration from the police.</p><p>"You just go around making notes and stopping people as you see fit because you think you have the powers of a police officer."</p><p>Goodall, from Poole, denied 13 offences of impersonating a police officer in Bournemouth, Poole, and Wimborne and using a vehicle fitted with a blue warning beacon.</p><p>He was found guilty by District Judge Orla Austin who said: "It is clear to me that he left (the police) in December 1996 and from that point his powers to act as a special constable ceased.</p><p>"Any subsequent identification as a special constable was an act calculated to suggest that he was and that was false.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"Similarly he was not entitled to illuminate his vehicle with blue lights and that is an offence."</p><p>She adjourned sentencing for reports and Goodall is due to appear in court later this month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgZFra2xvZWTDqrPIpZinrJVisbO11Z6pZqifqLKlecCsZJynoGKvrcHEZqOin5ipwHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fvigilante-driver-posed-as-cop-blue-lights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fvigilante-driver-posed-as-cop-blue-lights.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fvigilante-driver-posed-as-cop-blue-lights.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fvigilante-driver-posed-as-cop-blue-lights.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fvigilante-driver-posed-as-cop-blue-lights.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fvigilante-driver-posed-as-cop-blue-lights.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cory-gunzs-girlfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cory-gunzs-girlfriend-list.html>Who is Cory Gunz Dating Cory Gunz's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ariana-madix-tom-sandoval-started-banging-raquel-the-day-my-dog-died.html>Tom Sandoval Started Banging Raquel the Day My Dog Died!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ariana-madix-tom-sandoval-started-banging-raquel-the-day-my-dog-died.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

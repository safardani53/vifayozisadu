As a former educator, I’d say that’s a bit of a stretch; however, it’s obvious most curriculums are stuffed with information you probably won’t need later in life.</p><p>I mean, all the time and effort I put into learning about certain <a href=#>historical figures</a> or finding the slope of a line has done literally nothing for my intellectual abilities (or my financial stability).</p><p>While I’m sure most of us can recall tons of useless information we learned in school, TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@jacobmhoff</a> thinks he’s found the top five things, and I’m pretty sure you’d agree with at least one of the subjects he listed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘How many [expletive] triangles do you see out here? None!’ TikToker says trigonometry is a useless subject.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@jacobmhoff;Getty Images</a></figure><p>In Jacob Hoff’s hilarious yet insightful <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, he jumps right into his list of useless subjects taught in school. He reserves the No. 5 spot for trigonometry because “how many f------- triangles do you see out here? None,” according to Jacob.</p><p>While architects, surveyors, and astronauts might disagree with the content creator, he believes being taught trigonometry was wasted time in the classroom.</p><p>Coming in at No. 4 on Jacob’s list is ancient history. “If it’s ancient history, why are we wasting our f------- time with it, don’t we all have enough going on today?" He adds, “Why don’t we do future class where we worry about our f------- futures?”</p><p>Good idea, Jacob. Perhaps with better guidance and knowledge, the large percentage of millennials who are now <a href=#>turning to tiny houses</a> in order to fulfill their dreams of becoming homebuyers would actually be able to afford real-sized homes (myself included!).</p><p>Holding the No. 3 spot on Jacob’s list is algebra because he has “never, ever had to use y=mx+b, ever!” Given how futile algebra has proven to be to Jacob, he now questions why he wasted so many years learning the subject.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@jacobmhoff</a></figure><p>While I too have yet to put y=mx+b to use outside the classroom, I’d bet air traffic controllers and <a href=#>carpenters</a> would disagree with Jacob as these two types of jobs are listed on Indeed as those that use that particular area of mathematics.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jacobmhoff href=#>@jacobmhoff</a><p>Follow here and Instagram @jacobmhoff</p><a title="♬ original sound - Jacob Hoff" href=#>♬ original sound - Jacob Hoff</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The TikToker says PE is useless and was only good for giving him a “headache.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Up until this point, I’d have to say I agree with everything Jacob is saying. But, he may want to dial back on PE, although his commentary on the subject is absolutely comical! Jacob says PE earns the No. 2 spot on his list because “they didn’t teach me jack s--- in there.”</p><p>Personally, I didn’t appreciate being nearly forced to play Duck, Duck, Goose (the alternative would have been to take an F for the day) but that aside, PE wasn't all that bad.</p><p>He continues, “They just made me p----- off." Then, switching his tone as if he is directing his attention toward his PE teacher, Jacob says “You know what, you didn’t train me, you gave me a f------- headache.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@jacobmhoff</a></figure><p>While plenty of viewers agreed with Jacob, a commenter chimed in, “Is he actually serious with PE? That's the most useful one.” And I’d have to agree. While I wouldn’t exactly say PE is the most useful subject (I guess it depends on the school you attended), most PE classes do teach kids how to get in shape and make healthier choices (the rest is left up to their parents). PE also tends to be kids’ favorite part of the day.</p><p>Moving on to the final subject sitting atop Jacob’s list is, yes, you guessed it, another mathematical subject. “Finally, number one I'm giving to the devil himself, calculus.”</p><p>If you ever had the pleasure of taking calculus, then you know it’s no walk in the park. But even I can attest that all of the mind-boggling equations and functions I was forced to learn and memorize have served no purpose in my life thus far. But, then again, I didn’t land a career in chemical engineering nor did I pursue one in mathematics, so it would make sense why.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnMK6edKhmKudo2LCtLHLnqqsZaSdtq%2Bz0maunmWcmq6zuoyipWark528sLg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fguy-shares-useless-things-we-learn-in-school.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fguy-shares-useless-things-we-learn-in-school.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fguy-shares-useless-things-we-learn-in-school.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fguy-shares-useless-things-we-learn-in-school.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fguy-shares-useless-things-we-learn-in-school.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fguy-shares-useless-things-we-learn-in-school.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pierce-brosnan-son-dylan-graduates-college-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pierce-brosnan-son-dylan-graduates-college-pic.html>Pierce Brosnan Celebrates Son Dylan As He Graduates College: Pic Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rasheed-sulaimon.html>Fame | Rasheed Sulaimon net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rasheed-sulaimon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

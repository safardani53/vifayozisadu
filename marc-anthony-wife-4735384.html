He walked down the aisle with former Miss Universe <strong>Dayanara Torres</strong>, 48, in 2000 before his 2004 wedding to Jennifer. Following his and the “On the Floor” singer’s separation, he married model <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shannon De Lima</strong></a>, 34. Their marriage lasted two years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Most recently, Marc and his fourth wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nadia</strong> <strong>Ferreira</strong></a>, 24, welcomed their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child together</a> on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Father’s Day 2023</a>. This is Marc’s seventh child overall and comes just five months after they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>got married</a> in Miami. The happy parents took to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> at the time to announce that their bundle of joy had arrived. “God’s timing is always perfect Happy Father’s Day,” they captioned the black-and-white photo of their newborn.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite being divorced three times, Marc has not given up on love. On May 12, 2022 he and Nadia announced their engagement — and the couple walked down the aisle just 7 months later on Jan. 28, 2023. As some may be wondering if the fourth time’s the charm for Anthony, here’s a look back at his past marriages and relationship with his pageant queen fourth wife!</p><h2>Dayanara Torres</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Marc-Anthony-Dayanara-Torres-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Puerto Rican actress, reality star, and former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres and Marc Anthony walked down the aisle in Las Vegas in 2000. They welcomed two children into the world together: boys <strong>Cristian</strong> and <strong>Ryan</strong>, born in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Cristian and Ryan were the couple’s first children together, but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marc had two children</a>, <strong>Ariana</strong> and <strong>Chase</strong>, previously with his ex-girlfriend, <strong>Debbie Rosado</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Dayanara and Marc’s relationship was full of ups and downs. For instance, they broke up in July 2002 but then reconciled and renewed their vows in December of that year, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>. However, their love was numbered after giving birth to their second son and in 2004, they divorced after filing a mutual divorce petition.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Dayanara looked back on her and the Man on Fire actor’s divorce during Univision’s Spanish-language dance competition show Mira Quien Baila&nbsp;in 2017. “The hardest moment of my life was definitely the divorce,” she said with tears in her eyes, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “It’s been so many years now that someone can look back and say, ‘You know what, it had nothing to do with me.’”</p><h2>Jennifer Lopez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Marc-Anthony-Jennifer-Lopez-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony’s relationship</a> was not straightforward either. They met in 1998 while backstage at the Broadway musical, The Capeman, in which Marc had a part. Apparently, some of Marc’s first words to the “Jenny from the Block” singer were that he would marry her one day, which she recalled in her 2015 memoir, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>True Love</a>. However, they didn’t date right away. Jennifer divorced her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first husband, <strong>Ojani Noa,</strong></a> in 1998.&nbsp;She then dated rapper <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>P. Diddy</strong></a>, married and divorced her backup dancer&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cris Judd</strong></a>, and dated and got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>engaged to <strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, who she famously <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rekindled her love</a> with in 2021. It wasn’t until 2004 that Marc’s prediction came true and he dated and then quickly walked down the aisle with Jennifer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The couple seemed to be going strong when they welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>twins <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Emme</strong></a> in 2008. However, rumors of trouble began around 2009 and some even involved Marc’s ex-wife, Dayanara, as some said they were hooking up. Dayanara was quick to speak out against the gossip. “There are a lot of bad people out there,” she told El Nuevo Día, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People Espanol</a>. “He’s just the father of my kids. I’m not going to waste my energy on these rumors.” Two years later, though, Jennifer and Marc announced their separation, but didn’t legally end their marriage until 2014.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Jennifer has opened up about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>positive relationship with Marc</a> a handful of times since their divorce, and there seems to be absolutely no bad blood between the former lovers. “Marc and I are very good friends, we’re very supportive,” she gushed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Huffpost</a> in 2014. “I feel it’s my responsibility as a mom when their dad is not there to let them know that their dad loves them very much because that’s the doubt that they have when he’s not around or they haven’t seen him. That’s my job to do that the same way it’s his job when he’s with them to say, ‘Mommy is working and she loves you.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Plus, in 2017, as Jennifer and Marc were in the midst of creating a Spanish-language album together, she revealed that the collaboration made them closer. “Honestly, we’re always gonna be great friends. I’m always gonna be there for him, he’s always gonna be there for me,” she said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Live! With Kelly and Ryan</a>. How sweet!</p><h2>Shannon De Lima</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Marc-Anthony-Shannon-De-Lima-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Venezuelan model Shannon De Lima and Marc Anthony walked down the aisle in an intimate ceremony at the Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic in 2014. They began dating in 2012 after Marc’s separation from Jennifer and they had a very hush-hush engagement. However, after two years of marriage, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the pair called it quits</a>, announcing their split in November 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“Marc Anthony is devastated over his recent split [with Shannon De Lima],” a source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong></a> following the news. “This will make divorce number three for him. He wants to take a break from women and dating all together and just focus on himself and being a father for now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Although the couple never had a child together, Shannon had a son from a previous relationship and in 2017 revealed Marc still keeps in touch with him. ”When he saw Marc again it was so nice,” she said on an episode of Univision’s Despierta América, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “Marc was his dad. Dani still calls him ‘daddy.’ Dani has his dad, but Marc will be ‘Daddy Marc’ forever.” She also confirmed that she and Marc have always remained on good terms.</p><h2>Nadia Ferreira</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Marc-Anthony-Nadia-Ferreira-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>Marc certainly did take a break from women, but he never gave up on love. He made his red carpet debut with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>girlfriend, <strong>Madu Nicola</strong></a>, at the 2021 Billboard Latin Music Awards. However, that relationship quickly ended because by early 2022, rumors started to swirl that Marc and model and former Miss Universe contestant Nadia Ferreira were dating and they were spotted on a trip to Mexico City together. They went Instagram official in March and were never shy about showing off their love, frequently sharing snaps of each other and their daily lives online. By May, they were engaged.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nadia announced her engagement</a> to the Grammy-winning musician via her Instagram story on May 12. “Engagement partyyyyy!!! @marcanthony,” she wrote over a photo of her stunning diamond ring. While it’s not known exactly when their engagement happened, Nadia likely said, “Yes,” during her Florida getaway with Marc, where the two had been enjoying time together days before the announcement. Leading up to the exciting news, Nadia had posted on social media showing a champagne toast ahead of a night of partying on a luxury yacht on the waters of Miami. She already had the ring on during those celebrations.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>The couple tied the knot on Saturday, Jan. 28 in a lavish ceremony at the&nbsp;Pérez Art Museum Miami in a ceremony officiated by the Mayor of Miami, <strong>Francis X. Suarez</strong>. The star-studded affair was attended by the couple’s close friends, including former <strong>Spice Girl</strong> turned fashion designer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a>, whose husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David Beckham</strong></a> was the best man, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. The publication also revealed that the bride wore a dress by <strong>Galia Lahav</strong> and the groom opted for a look from<strong> Christian Dior</strong>‘s Mens Line.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Just two weeks after the wedding, the happy couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced they are expecting</a> their first child together with a joint photo shared to Instagram. “Best Valentine’s Gift Ever!!! Gracias Dios por esta bendición tan grande en nuestras vidas,” they wrote alongside a picture of both their hands caressing Nadia’s baby bump. The second sentence in their caption, translated from Spanish to English, said, “Thank you God for this big blessing in our lives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yaqZxlkaPBqbvNsmSwoZaaenWDkm5qcWxf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarc-anthony-wife-4735384.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarc-anthony-wife-4735384.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarc-anthony-wife-4735384.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarc-anthony-wife-4735384.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarc-anthony-wife-4735384.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarc-anthony-wife-4735384.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./demi-lovato-and-nick-jonas-selling-10000-vip-tour-package.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./demi-lovato-and-nick-jonas-selling-10000-vip-tour-package.html>Demi Lovato and Nick Jonas Selling $10,000 VIP Tour Package</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-lena-headey-nude-photo-chronicles.html>The Lena Headey Nude Photo Chronicles</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-lena-headey-nude-photo-chronicles.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

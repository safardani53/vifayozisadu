<time>19 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Lindsey Simon Gurk recently became vulnerable about her Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder, also known as PMDD, on Instagram.</p><p>She shared two videos with a lengthy caption, revealing her struggles with PMDD and how difficult time she had with the disorder her entire life. But fortunately, she was now okay and had not been experiencing the pain for over six months.</p><p>Here is everything she shared about her situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lindsey Simon Gurk on Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h2><p>In her first video, uploaded on March 21, 2023, on Instagram, Gurk stressfully shared how she had been struggling with PMDD for a very long time.&nbsp;</p><p>She initially shared her experience in September 2022 to help others who were going through the same as her. In the video, she explained how she tried everything she could to fix it.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of them were working. One such day when she was in deep pain, she cried in her bathroom, feeling worthless.</p><p>She was feeling suicidal and started imagining her husband’s and children’s life without her. Gurk has been with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">husband, Mike</a>, for over a decade, and the couple has two kids.</p><p>After feeling suicidal, for the first time in her life, the influencer went down on her knees and prayed to God. She begged to end her pain and asked him to use her.</p><p>She knew her pain would last forever, and the only solution she had was to pray to God. Surprisingly, after that incident, she did not experience PMDD.</p><p>At the time of her uploading the video, she was free from PMDD for six months. Years of pain were gone, and she did not even experience premenstrual syndrome.&nbsp;</p><p>In her second video, Gurk explained gleefully how a massive burden had been lifted from her shoulders. She felt that she did not deserve the blessing but was very grateful to be pain-free after so long.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lindsey-Simon-Gurk.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Lindsey Simon Gurk explained her experience with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder on Instagram. (Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>)</p><p>She claimed that getting rid of PMDD was a miracle to her, and was happy that she could lead a normal life. In the captions of the video, she shared how uncomfortable it was to share the thoughts she had.</p><p>Regardless, she believed it was important for her to be vulnerable. She wrote, “But I feel it’s necessary to be completely open and vulnerable so that you all can better understand just how dark things got.”</p><p>Gurk’s life was a living hell because of PMDD. Her entire life and schedule revolved around the disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained, “I actually rearranged my schedule around PMDD. No extended family dinners, girls’ nights, trips, or catch-up phone calls during that time of the month. Again, I didn’t want to bring anyone down.”</p><p>Thankfully, her husband was there to see how horrible it was for her and be there to support his wife.</p><p>Gurk admitted that PMDD suddenly disappearing might sound fake, but it was not. She was being honest and shared her truth with her fans and followers on Instagram.</p><p>She wrote, “Also, I know not everyone shares my beliefs, so thank you for allowing me to share this.” At last, she urged her followers to ask God with an open mind what they wanted, and their wishes might be granted.&nbsp;</p><p>“Ask questions. Don’t blindly believe… SEEK the answers with an open heart and quizzical mind. You WILL find Him. And you’ll realize He’s been there with you all along… just waiting,” she ended her statement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is premenstrual dysphoric disorder?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PMDD</a> is a medical condition that affects some women during their menstrual cycle. It is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) that causes physical and emotional symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>These symptoms start to appear a week or two before menstruation and disappear after the onset of the menstrual cycle. PMDD is characterized by various symptoms, including mood swings, irritability, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, depression, and fatigue.&nbsp;</p><p>Some women may also experience physical symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, and joint pain. The symptoms can be severe enough to disrupt the woman’s daily life and relationships.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It's <a href=# rel=noopener>#PMDD</a> awareness month. When I first started my PMDD journey I was so scared and confused. It's still hard, but there is power in understanding what's happening to my mind every month. It's so much more than PMS and really should be taught about in schools! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vUjUqHGMCZ</a></p>— Haley Biddanda (@Haley_Biddanda) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 21, 2023</a></figure><p>PMDD is believed to be caused by a combination of hormonal and chemical imbalances in the brain. The female hormones estrogen and progesterone play a crucial role in regulating menstrual cycles and affect the brain’s neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine.&nbsp;</p><p>These neurotransmitters are responsible for regulating mood, appetite, and sleep. When the levels of these hormones fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, it can cause PMDD symptoms.</p><p>PMDD affects approximately 5-8% of women who are of reproductive age. It is more common in women who have a history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Women with a family history of PMDD or mood disorders are also at a higher risk of developing PMDD. Diagnosis of PMDD can be challenging, as its symptoms are similar to other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and thyroid disorders.&nbsp;</p><p>However, doctors can diagnose PMDD by evaluating the woman’s symptoms over several menstrual cycles and ruling out other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The only way I can describe how PMDD feels to me is that it's like being tortured, but I'm being tortured by myself. For 20 years I was told it was "just PMS" & was put on the pill, then had the contraceptive implant (which gave CONSTANT mood swings)… <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nxM6jDiU01</a></p>— ☆~Sazy~☆ (@Sazy_M87) <a href=# rel=noopener>March 20, 2023</a></figure><p>Treatment for PMDD varies depending on the severity of the symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed through lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management techniques.&nbsp;</p><p>Women with more severe symptoms may require medication such as antidepressants or hormonal birth control pills to regulate their hormone levels. In severe cases, women may require surgical removal of their ovaries to eliminate the hormonal fluctuations that cause PMDD.</p><p>PMDD can significantly impact a woman’s quality of life and relationships. Women who experience these symptoms should speak to their doctor for diagnosis and treatment. With proper treatment, women with PMDD can manage their symptoms and improve their overall well-being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57xLGapa2jnsOme8uipZ2rla56tLXMqKVmn6WnuG68zJ2baA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flindsey-simon-gurk-pmdd.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flindsey-simon-gurk-pmdd.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flindsey-simon-gurk-pmdd.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flindsey-simon-gurk-pmdd.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flindsey-simon-gurk-pmdd.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flindsey-simon-gurk-pmdd.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sadie-robertson-baby-name.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sadie-robertson-baby-name.html>Sadie Robertson's Baby Name Revealed in Sweet Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stormy-daniels-for-the-love-of-dilfs-season-2-trailer-exclusive-8416339.html>For the Love of DILFs' Stormy Daniels Recruits Himbos, Daddies (Exclusive)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stormy-daniels-for-the-love-of-dilfs-season-2-trailer-exclusive-8416339.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

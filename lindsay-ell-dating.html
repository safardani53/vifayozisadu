The Canadian <a href=#>country singer</a> is already winning critical acclaim for her new album, and she's discussed the various experiences that inspired her powerful lyrics.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Who is Lindsay Ell dating?</a> The artist behind "Waiting on You" had a high profile relationship with a public figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Lindsay Ell have a boyfriend?</h2><p>The 31-year-old singer has been single since her relationship with radio personality and Dancing with the Stars winner Bobby Bones ended. The couple started dating in 2016, and they split after a year of dating. Before they were a romantic item, Bobby and Lindsay were friends for several years.&nbsp;</p><p>Lindsay explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that "heart theory" is not an album filled with breakup anthems but, rather, it's one centered around tracks about self-reflection.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"This record is more about heartbreak in general because when you go through a breakup, it causes you to look back on all the past relationships and notice patterns. It's been more of an inner look of like, OK, Lindsay, what are you doing time and time again? And what is good? What is bad? How do you show up right? How do you not show up right?" she said.&nbsp;</p><p>She also confirmed to the outlet that she had remained friends with Bobby, in spite their breakup.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Lindsay Ell and Bobby Bones break up?</h2><p>When Lindsay and Bobby first began dating in 2016, The Bobby Bones Show host said that he wanted to keep their relationship private. He feared that his reputation and competition concerns would prevent radio stations from playing Lindsay's music.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"We started dating and I was like, 'We probably should think about this before we date because it could hurt your career. Other radio stations, Spotify, they're going to hold it against you that youâ€™re dating me. I don't even know these people but they're going to hold it against you.' And they did," he said on his radio show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Country.</a></p><p>He explained that this eventually put a strain on their romance and that Lindsay paid a price with her music for dating him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"There was at one point a big controversy that a station in Sacramento wouldn't let her in the building to play because she was dating me," he said, hinting at how Sacramento's KNCI station canceled Lindsay's appearance on the show in June of 2017. "There were many, many instances of this happening over and over again."&nbsp;</p><p>"It started to put a stress in our relationship to me where I felt it was my fault because she wasn't able to get anything going. Her whole life she's tried to make it as an artist. She finally puts out a record and the record goes #1 and then radio stations all over the country won't play it because she's dating me," he said. "It was weird stress that amplified everything else."</p><p>Now that Lindsay and Bobby's relationship is over, there should be no "weird stress" standing in Lindsay's way for her new album. "heart theory" comes out on Aug. 21.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobavsNKasGadnKF6pa3ToqWg</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flindsay-ell-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flindsay-ell-dating.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flindsay-ell-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flindsay-ell-dating.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flindsay-ell-dating.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flindsay-ell-dating.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./years-canadian-musician-mac-demarco-s-salary-from-his-profession-net-worth-has-achieved.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./years-canadian-musician-mac-demarco-s-salary-from-his-profession-net-worth-has-achieved.html>Canadian Musician Mac DeMarco's Salary and Net Worth: His Success As A Musician</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zlk4fvnrgupof3pny7swkfw0t5prgydk.html>Watch Basketball Wives Season 6 Episode 1: Episode 1</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zlk4fvnrgupof3pny7swkfw0t5prgydk.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

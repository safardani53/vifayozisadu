There is no information about his father. However, his mother is Carolyn Kayles. They are the natives of Texas state.</p><p>Born and brought up in Texas, Randle attended Prestonwood Christian Academy (PCA) in Plano. He began playing basketball with his friends from a very young age. As his mother was a former basketball player, she inspired her son from the very start.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Randle-with-his-mother-Carolyn.jpg><p>Carolyn started teaching him basketball when he was still a toddler. He, too, enjoyed playing with his elder sister, Nastassia, and mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, his mother admitted him to the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) when he was just in 5th grade. He soon started playing AAU tournaments and impressed the coaches and spectators alike.</p><p>Jeff Webster, a former NBA player, was one of those many spectators who saw the upcoming star player in him. As a result, he would often visit young Randle and mentor him.&nbsp;</p><p>Julius considers his mother as his everything and totally feels that her sacrifice and contribution brought him to the place where he is today. Likewise, Carolyn wanted her son to be strong and stand out in every arena of life.</p><p>Just like his mother expected, Julius made it to his high school team and played good basketball for his team. He showed great talent and always ranked at high positions in every event.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it was a great challenge to maintain his status as the best player and be good in his studies, Randle handled it pretty well.</p><p>After high school, he enrolled in the University of Kentucky for his further education and continued his basketball career.</p><h2>Julius Randle | Career</h2><h3>High School Career</h3><p>Julius Randle played high school basketball for the Prestonwood Christian Academy. He was extremely good from his early games and continued to play exceptionally well till his last season.</p><p>In his junior season, the athlete led his team to the Under Armour Elite 24 dunk Contest win. As a result, he was declared the tournament’s MVP. However, his performance already made him a star while still in high school.</p><p>Going into the senior season, he did much better, and at the end of the season, the basketball analysts and top experts named him one of the best power forwards in the country.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Ja Morant Bio: Basketball Career & Relation >>></strong></a></p><p>As a result, many universities wanted him to pursue his career with them.

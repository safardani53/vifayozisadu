Their marriage fell apart in 1973, but they stayed friends.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SHOWBIZ</h2></p><h2>How close are Priscilla and Tom Jones?</h2><p>Having met at the height of their 1960s heyday, Tom Jones and Priscilla Presley set tongues wagging after meeting for dinner in Los Angeles earlier this year.</p><p>Priscilla has since denied any romance with the Welsh crooner.</p><p>Appearing on Good Morning Britain in June 2017, she said: "Tom and I have been friends since '68. It is true. That's not the first time we've been out obviously, but probably the first outing in public.</p><p>"But always friendship, always friends. He's a great guy. Part of that was because he lost his wife, that was the love of his life. It was kind of friends getting together to support him."</p><p>Tom had previously admitted Priscilla's ex-husband Elvis would have reservations about them getting close.</p><p>Tom told The Sun: "I really don’t know how Elvis would feel about us having dinner together – he probably wouldn’t be too sure."</p><h2>How many children does Priscilla Presley have?</h2><p>Priscilla and Elvis had one daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who was born on February 1, 1968.</p><p>On January 12, 2023, news broke that Lisa died after suffering full cardiac arrest, aged 54.</p><p>Priscilla Presley, confirmed the news of her daughter's passing and said: "It is with a heavy heart that I must share the devastating news that my beautiful daughter Lisa Marie has left us."</p><p>The actress went on: "She was the most passionate, strong, and loving woman I have ever known. We ask for privacy as we try to deal with this profound loss.</p><p>"Thank you for your love and prayers. At this time there will be no further comment."</p><p>She&nbsp;has been married four times, including to singer <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> for&nbsp;two years, although they continued to date for two years after they split.</p><p>The pair met in&nbsp;1975 when a seven-year-old Presley attended several of his concerts in Las Vegas and became friends in adult life in 1992, where she helped him through his most troubled times.</p><p>She also has a son, Navarone Anthony Garibaldi, who was born on March 1, 1987. He is a musician and the son of Priscilla's former long-term partner businessman Marco Garibaldi.</p><h2>What else is Priscilla Presley famous for?</h2><p>As well as&nbsp;turning Graceland, Elvis' home, into a top tourist attraction, she also acted in Dallas and three Naked Gun spoof comedy films.</p><p>She is&nbsp;an Ambassador of the Dream Foundation, a charity that grants wishes to&nbsp;terminally ill adults and their families.</p><p>Presley is also a devoted member of the controversial Church of Scientology.</p><h2>What was Priscilla Presley's dispute with Riley Keough over Lisa Marie Presley's estate?</h2><p>Lisa Marie Presley was the sole heir to Elvis' estate and inherited his Graceland home in 1993 when she turned 25.</p><p>Before Lisa inherited the estate, her mother and executors of the estate had grown it to an estimated £76.9million. However, she sold an 85 per cent of it in 2004 for a reported £80million.</p><p>After the tragic death of Lisa Marie in January 13, 2023 - the grieving family began to be broken apart by a bitter row between Priscilla and her granddaughter <a href=#>Riley Keough </a>- the oldest child of Lisa.</p><p>Actress Riley is said to have been upset when her grandmother arrived at the funeral with Lisa’s fourth husband <a href=#>Michael Lockwood</a>, whom her mother had only split from six months before.</p><p>Sources say it was the “last thing” Lisa would have wanted.</p><p>However, other sources has claimed the feud began before and that the pair were barely speaking even before the funeral.</p><p>Soon after the funeral, Priscilla launched a legal bid to take control of Elvis’s estate from Riley, who inherited it after her moth's death.</p><p>The lawsuit questions the “authenticity and validity” of Lisa’s decision to remove Priscilla as a trustee of the Presley estate in 2016 and replace her with Riley and her brother&nbsp;<a href=#>Benjamin</a>, who died in 2020.</p><p>The trust owns Elvis’s old home, the&nbsp;Graceland mansion in <a href=#>Memphis</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Tennessee</a>, and a 15 per cent stake in Elvis Presley Enterprises, which together brought in a reported £90million last year.</p><p>The feuding pair were said to be barely on speaking terms and friends close to Riley — who stars in new Prime Video drama Daisy Jones & The Six — said she was devastated by the rift.</p><p>A source said: “She is heartbroken that this has turned into a public matter and knows her mother would never want this.</p><p>“Riley is very stressed and has been trying to keep a positive attitude.”</p><p>Sources say “heartbroken” Riley is trying to get over the pain of losing her mum by focusing on being a mum to her new baby.</p><p>In April, 2023, Lisa Marie's half-brother insisted that <a href=#>Priscilla and Riley was not on the rocks.</a></p><p>Musician Navarone Garibaldi, whose father is Priscilla's ex film producer Marco Garibaldi, said that they "have not fallen out and they are very close".</p><p>He added: "I hope people will now stop saying nasty things about Priscilla. She is human just like we all are. Leave her alone and let her enjoy what ever yrs she has left please."</p><p>The family row was supposed to come to a head with a court case on April 13, but Priscilla's legal team asked for it to be pushed until May.</p><p>On May 16, 2023, the crisis over Elvis' estate appeared to be finally over after Priscilla and Riley reached a settlement after months of the very public family saga.</p><p>Priscilla's attorney, Ronson Shamoun, told reporters outside the LA court: "They have reached a settlement. Families are happy."</p><p>The statement was echoed by Riley's attorney, Justin Gold, who said: "She would not have agreed to the settlement if she was not happy with it. She is very content."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqaW6CdHyXaKeroaOYtq24wGanq52jobK6ecSlraKrXaW%2Fpr%2FLnrBmr5mbsm6vx6KjnaqVo3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpriscilla-presley-elvis-presley-wife-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpriscilla-presley-elvis-presley-wife-children.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpriscilla-presley-elvis-presley-wife-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpriscilla-presley-elvis-presley-wife-children.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpriscilla-presley-elvis-presley-wife-children.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpriscilla-presley-elvis-presley-wife-children.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./love-is-blind-season-6-netflix-shows-release-date-cast-and-more-5175824.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./love-is-blind-season-6-netflix-shows-release-date-cast-and-more-5175824.html>Netflix Shows Release Date, Cast and More Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adam-jones.html>Adam Jones</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adam-jones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

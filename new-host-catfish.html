She first appeared on the series in 2019 as a guest host.</p><p>The MTV star is otherwise best known for winning Miss Teen USA in 2010, representing her home state of Maryland. But she's appeared on several shows, like Hell's Kitchen and Tamron Hall.

Kamie has also added meaningful discussions about race and social justice, which viewers didn't really get to see as much before.</p><p>Kamie herself is of Jamaican, German, English, Cuban, Indian, and African-American descent, and she's incredibly proud of her heritage.

She's also brought a different energy to the episodes, which was needed when Nev and Kamie filmed them remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>During his discussion with Distractify, Nev opened up about Kamie's presence on the show, and why their natural rapport translates so well on the screen.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"We never expected things to go the way they did," Nev said, hinting at Max's departure in 2018. "But, I am just delighted every day that I get to spend with Kamie. With every episode that we get to film together, it just further confirms the choice that we made."</p><p>The DWTS alum added that he has become close friends with Kamie, and that she is "just so fantastic at her job" as an internet sleuth on Catfish.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"What she brings to the show in terms of personality and knowledge and references — it's just so invaluable," he said, before noting that Kamie's younger age allows her to connect with the people who write in as well.</p><p>"She's so intuitive. She's so intelligent. I just think she's the best," he concluded. "I'm excited to keep working with her, and for the show to keep evolving as our friendship continues to evolve."</p><p>Catch Catfish (get it?) every Wednesday on MTV at 8 p.m. EST.</p><p>Reporting by: Shannon Raphael</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7K4eceoqq1lk5bBp7XSoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnew-host-catfish.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnew-host-catfish.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnew-host-catfish.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnew-host-catfish.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnew-host-catfish.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnew-host-catfish.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ursula-from-the-little-mermaid-makes-like-kim-kardashian-shows-o.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ursula-from-the-little-mermaid-makes-like-kim-kardashian-shows-o.html>Ursula from The Little Mermaid Makes Like Kim Kardashian, Shows Off Butt Crack</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nadeska-alexis-19860815-html.html>Nadeska Alexis (Journalist) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nadeska-alexis-19860815-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

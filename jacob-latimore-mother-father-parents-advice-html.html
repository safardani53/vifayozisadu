Naturally, with that belief, they&nbsp;were the first people he wanted to discuss any situation with.&nbsp;</p><p>He admitted that contrary to his peers or people his age, he had never wanted to hide anything from his parents.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He also credited the urge to hide incidents from one’s parents stemmed from a sense of embarrassment about what parents might think.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, in his experience, more often than not, sharing those embarrassing moments helped him relate to his parents on a different plane.&nbsp;</p><h2>Making a Name in the Industry&nbsp;</h2><p>Latimore <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">came</a> into the entertainment industry at the age of nine with his music&nbsp;in 2005. By 2010, he had secured a spot in acting with his first movie, Vanishing on 7th Street.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He is also a part of major titles like&nbsp;Black Nativity, Ride Along, and The Maze Runner. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2016, he came out with his first album ‘Connection’ and garnered a musical fanbase.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>His first leading role came in 2018 on Lena Waithe’s&nbsp;The Chi, where he shared a screen with stars like&nbsp;Tiffany Boone and&nbsp;Jason Mitchell.</p><p>In light of all that, Latimore’s success has been heavily attributed to his beautiful momager who has been with him every step of the way.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>He Lived with His Mother</h2><p>Latimore was born to his parents when they were still in high school. Sadly, the high school romance didn’t last, and the couple eventually split, leaving Latimore with his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite him living with his mother in <a href=# rel=follow>Atlanta</a>, Latimore remained close to his father.&nbsp;</p><p>As for&nbsp;his musical career, Taylor already had a connection to the music industry, as she had been working for Sony Music since before she graduated.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She had graduated with a bachelor’s degree in marketing with a focus in fashion, marketing, and merchandising at the Illinois Institute of Art.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In her five years with the company,&nbsp;Taylor spent her time learning everything she needed to kick off her son’s career and start her own talent management company.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>He Listens to His Momager</h2><p>In an interview with Rolling Out, Taylor explained how the most difficult&nbsp;thing for a manager would be to have a client who doesn’t take directions, doesn’t listen to advice, and is generally hard to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>Going by Latimore’s statement from before, he bears none of those ill traits, and so by extension, Taylor must have a great time working with her son.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another conversation, the momager had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that her son’s career was practically on autopilot in recent days.</p><p>According to her, Latimore was willing to learn the business side of Hollywood while still working on his creative side, making her job that much easier.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8mamqiaXaGutbXMqKmeZZ2kwamx0WadmqyYmr9uvMCrnKeso2KupcLInJxnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjacob-latimore-mother-father-parents-advice-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjacob-latimore-mother-father-parents-advice-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjacob-latimore-mother-father-parents-advice-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjacob-latimore-mother-father-parents-advice-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjacob-latimore-mother-father-parents-advice-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjacob-latimore-mother-father-parents-advice-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jeff-gordons-wife-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jeff-gordons-wife-list.html>Jeff Gordons Wife: Who is Jeff Gordon Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bam-margeras-wife-list.html>Bam Margeras Wife: Who is Bam Margera Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bam-margeras-wife-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

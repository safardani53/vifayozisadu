In fact, some might even say that it’s impossible.</p><p>However, <strong>Giovanni Reyna</strong> has dared to dream what most perceive as unachievable, which replicates his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/reyna-924.jpeg><p>Nevertheless, young Gio is on the right path to becoming a fantastic footballer, which has currently landed him in Germany’s Bundesliga.</p><p>And judging by the little cameos that Reyna has been able to offer, we have full faith that the 17-year-old can become one of the best players in the future.</p><p>However, this is not an article discussing Giovanni’s future. Instead, this article informs our dear readers about young Reyna’s early life and his career to date.</p><p>Besides, we have also provided information on his net worth, salary, nationality, stats, family, age, and social media.</p><p>Before getting into details about the footballer’s life, career, and childhood with a professional football player father, here are some quick facts you can dive into.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=mytable width=795><tbody readability=3.3265565438374><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Giovanni Alejandro Reyna</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>November 13, 2002</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>Sunderland, England</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>Claudio Reyna</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>Daniella Egan Reyna</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Jack Reyna, Joah Reyna, Carolina Reyna</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>21 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>6’1″ (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoe Size</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Measurement</strong></td><td>Not available</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Build</strong></td><td>Lean</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Married</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Girlfriend</strong></td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Merch</strong></td><td><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Autographed Rookie Card</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Position</strong></td><td>Attacking Midfielder</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Football Player</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Clubs&nbsp;</strong></td><td>Borussia Dortmund(Current), New York City FC (Former)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jersey Number</strong></td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td><a href=#>Instagram</a>, <a href=#>Twitter</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Shoes</strong></td><td>Nike</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td>November, 2023</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Giovanni Reyna | Early Life & Career</h2><p>Giovanni Alejandro Reyna was born on November 13, 2002, in Sunderland, England. However, young Reyna had to move away from England at a very young age because his father, Claudio, decided to sign for the New York Red Bulls.</p><p>Subsequently, following his father’s footsteps, young Gio enrolled in the New York City FC youth academy to provide better facilities.</p><p>Thereafter, he spent his whole teenage years with the academy making himself one of the top prospects in the entire nation.</p><p>In fact, Giovanni even helped his youth side win the 2017 Generation Adidas Cup and be awarded the best player in the tournament.</p><p>Added to that, the 17-year-old also helped the U.S U15’s to the prestigious Torneo Delle Nazioni Cup win.</p><h2>Giovanni Reyna | Professional Career</h2><p>A host of top European teams wanted to sign the young prodigy not only because of his huge potential but also because he was a free agent.</p><p>But in the end, it was German giants Borussia Dortmund&nbsp;who managed to secure the service of the talented 17-year-old in January 2020.</p><p>Since then, the attacking midfielder has gone on to make 27 appearances for Dortmund’s U-19 team and the senior team. Likewise, in those 27 appearances, Reyna has managed an impressive nine goals and nine assists.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, some memorable moments of the young American’s time in Germany include him breaking the youngest ever American record to play in the Bundesliga at 17 years and 66 days.</p><p>Interestingly, the record was previously held by Chelsea’s tricky winger, <a href=# rel=noopener>Christian Pulisic</a>.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diego Rossi Bio: Career, Stats, Salary, Transfers, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>And, if Gio is to follow in the footsteps of Pulisic, then we are in for a treat. However, that is not the only record that the young attacking midfielder has broken.</p><p>In fact, Reyna became the youngest goalscorer in German Cup history when he scored against Werder Bremen in a 2-3 defeat on February 4, 2020.</p><p>Furthermore, the 17-year-old also holds the record for being the youngest American to play and record an assist in a Champions League fixture.</p><p>To illustrate, Giovanni came on in the 57th minute against Paris Saint Germain in a Champions League round of 16 ties.</p><p>After nine minutes, Reyna set up another wunderkind, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erling Haaland</a>, for the match-winning goal, which put them 2-1 up going into the second leg.</p><p>But unfortunately, Dortmund wound up losing the second leg as they could not contain <a href=# rel=noopener>Kylian Mbappe</a> and <a href=#>Neymar</a>‘s likes<strong>.</strong></p><p>Nevertheless, we fully expect Gio to develop further because, let’s not forget, the England-born midfielder is only 17 years of age.</p><p>With possibly another 17 years of professional career left in his body, be rest assured that we will hear about this exceptional talent much more in the future.</p><h2>How old is Giovanni Reyna? Height & Position</h2><p>Discussing his age, Gio was born in the year 2002, which makes him just 17 years old.&nbsp; Most other kids still worry about their assignments at his age but not Reyna, as he is playing the first professional season of his career.</p><p>Let’s take a moment and think about what we were doing at such a young age? Well, I’m not sure whether I was doing anything productive during those years, and I’m pretty confident that most of you didn’t either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/reyna-925.jpg><p>Returning to the matter at hand, the young attacking midfielder stands at a staggering 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 meters) tall. As a result, the England-born player can score goals with his feet and with his head using his height.</p><p>In conclusion, Giovanni has a lot of time to develop his physical attributes and his mental abilities as well.</p><p>Thus, we believe that whenever young Reyna manages to do that, he will be counted amongst the best players in the world.</p><h2>Giovanni Reyna | Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2021, Reyna has a net worth of <strong>$500,000</strong> accrued mainly through his football career.</p><p>Although the sum might seem a bit less for a professional footballer, Giovanni is only 17 years old at the moment.</p><p>Thus, we feel that his net worth will grow significantly over the coming years.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Domagoj Vida Bio: Croatia, Wife, Stats, Net Worth, Salary, Career Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Furthermore, Reyna recently signed for Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer from MLS club New York City FC.</p><p>Consequently, per his contract with Dortmund, the 17-year-old is set to earn <strong>€500,000 per year</strong> or <strong>€9,600 per week</strong>. However, judging by his talent, we are pretty sure that the young American will be making a lot more in the future.</p><h2>Giovanni Reyna | Father & Family</h2><p>Talking about his family, Giovanni Reyna was born to his parents, <strong>Claudio</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Reyna</strong> and <strong>Daniella Egan Reyna</strong>. Interestingly, both of Gio’s parents played football professionally during their time.</p><p>For instance, Claudio played for U.K based clubs like Rangers, Sunderland, Manchester City, and the U.S men’s national team, while Daniella played for the U.S women’s national team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/reyna-926.jpg><p>Furthermore, Reyna is the second oldest amongst the four siblings. To explain, the 17-year-old has an elder brother <strong>Jack Reyna</strong> and two younger ones in <strong>Joah Reyna</strong> and <strong>Carolina Reyna</strong>.</p><p>Currently, six families have been separated due to the England-born midfielder’s move to Dortmund. Consequently, Gio and his father live in Germany while the rest of the family are back home in the U.S.</p><p>Nonetheless, judging by the talent of Reyna, who knows his whole family might move to Europe to reap the rewards of the 17-year-old midfielder’s success.</p><h2>Giovanni Reyna | Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=#>Instagram</a>: 159k followers</p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a>: 14.8k followers</p><h2>Giovanni Reyna | FAQs</h2><h3>How do you pronounce Giovanni Reyna?</h3><p>The footballer’s name is pronounced as jee-uh-vaa-nee r-ai-nuh.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is Giovanni Reyna’s market value?</h3><p>Reyna’s market value is €38.00m.&nbsp;</p><h3>Can Giovanni Reyna play for England?</h3><p>Yes, Reyna can still play for England’s national team as he was born in Sunderland, which is a metropolitan city in the Northern parts of England.</p><p>However, Gio is also eligible to play for the U.S national team as his father, Claudio, is a U.S citizen.</p><h3>What is Giovanni Reyna’s wage?</h3><p>As per his recent contract in 2020, the footballer is set to earn 1.6 million Euros per year.</p><h3>Where did Giovanni Reyna grow up?</h3><p>Although Reyna was born in England, he grew up in America.</p><h3>Is Giovanni Reyna related to Claudio Reyna?</h3><p>Yes, Claudio Reyna is Giovanni Reyna’s father.&nbsp;</p><h3>What position does Reyna Play?</h3><p>Gio plays as an attacking midfielder for his current club Borussia Dortmund and the U.S under-17 team to answer the question.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCzyKitmqaennqzsdinmGaamaR8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgiovanni-reyna-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgiovanni-reyna-bio.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgiovanni-reyna-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgiovanni-reyna-bio.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgiovanni-reyna-bio.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgiovanni-reyna-bio.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-simpson-wears-daisy-dukes-shows-off-toned-legs-in-new-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-simpson-wears-daisy-dukes-shows-off-toned-legs-in-new-pic.html>Jessica Simpson Wears Daisy Dukes, Shows Off Toned Legs in New Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./scott-disick-and-sofia-richie-drinking-doing-coke-in-nyc.html>Drinking, Doing Coke in NYC?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./scott-disick-and-sofia-richie-drinking-doing-coke-in-nyc.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

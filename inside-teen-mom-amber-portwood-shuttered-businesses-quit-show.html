Do what you gotta do to keep your job."</p><p>Amber could likely have used those words of advice earlier in her professional career.</p><p>Take a look back at some of her failed business ventures.</p><h2>PORTWOOD AF</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/teen-mom-fans-rip-amber-691696614.png><p>Amber's most recent failed endeavour was a clothing brand bearing her name</p><p>Portwood AF launched in November 2021.</p><p>Amber announced the business months after she was arrested for allegedly attacking ex&nbsp;<a href=#>Andrew Glennon</a>&nbsp;with a machete.</p><p>The line featured shirts that said "Portwood AF," and "I'm going to Portwood your a**."</p><p>Almost immediately, fans took issue with the latter, <a href=#>suggesting that it was celebrating violence</a>.</p><p>One Instagram user wrote: "<a href=#>A little tone deaf</a>&nbsp;given her criminal/civil proceedings. I'd be pissed if I was her lawyer lol."</p><p>Another social media user wrote: "Are the profits going to domestic violence shelters or to help single parents who have custody of their kids? Heck even to Gary? .... Cause then the answer is NO!!! AF"</p><p>A third added: "I'm going to Portwood your a**. Seriously? Machete springs to mind. I'm sure Leah isn't embarrassed by this at all."</p><h2>THE PRICE IS WRONG</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/poor-portwood-inside-teen-mom-791347856.jpg><p>It wasn't just the message that fans took issue with, as Amber's followers were quick to point out that the pieces in the Portwood AF collection were overpriced.</p><p>One critic wrote: "Are people seriously buying this? No offense, but It's a little pricey for a hoodie with your last name on it imo portwood your a**? What? I'm confused."</p><p>Another suggested Amber "turn off the comments now," while others said it was a "hard no" for them.</p><p>In response, the reality star fired back with an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>.</p><p>"There is only room for positive people and energy in this space. If you feel any negative or hateful feelings towards a person then there is no need for you here,"&nbsp;Amber&nbsp;wrote.</p><p>She continued: "My new line #portwoodaf does not condone any sort of violence and comments referring that is so do not belong here. This was a fun project that I made taking different sayings from supporters and started wearing myself at first and now sharing with you."</p><p>Less than three months later, the clothing was pulled. All that remains now in a shell of its former website.</p><h2>FOREVER HAUTE</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/poor-portwood-inside-teen-mom-791347855.jpg><p>Portwood AF is not Amber's first venture into fashion.</p><p>She launched another line, Forever Haute, in 2016.</p><p>“I’m so excited to introduce my new #FoeverHaute make-up line!!” Amber teased at the time. “It’s amazing quality and yes I use it myself."</p><p>But According to a report from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>, the business was shut down in 2019 by the state of Indiana.</p><p>“The business entity report was due in September 2018,” a clerk told&nbsp;RadarOnline.com. “It’s pending admin dissolution. If the report is not filed, the business would no longer be in good standing with Indiana. It would be a non-active business.”</p><p>Amber's Instagram page promoted her makeup and clothing line shortly after it launched.</p><p>"Go to my boutique www.beforeverhaute.com for our new line of Spring and Summer clothes!" she shared in an online message. "Also make sure to check out our new Forever Haute make-up line as well."</p><p>However visiting the site now merely brings up a "404 Not Found" error message.</p><h2>FLIPPED OFF</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/2015-mtv-movie-awards-nokia-631413615.jpg><p>Way back in 2016, Amber launched one of her first ideas - buying and flipping houses.</p><p>At the time, she told Cosmopolitan that she was investing her Teen Mom money in the new business model.</p><p>"I run my own business. I'm a home investor and a house flipper," she told the <a href=#>magazine</a>. "I'm going to invest in homes in Florida here soon.</p><p>"I make great money doing it and it's a great way to invest the money that I made from&nbsp;Teen Mom."</p><p>However, in her tell-all memoir, So, You’re Crazy Too?, Amber revealed that she <a href=#>lost all of her profits to shady ex-boyfriends</a> whom she gave access to her bank accounts.</p><p>She claimed this led to her ex-fiance Matt Baier pocketing over $140,000 from her.</p><p>Amber said the two had flipped a house together, which she said she paid for, but the reality star had put it all in her ex’s name.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>After they sold it and Amber checked out what she’d received from the profits and what was missing from her account, she claimed: “I realized that my fiancé had taken over $140,000 and put it in his pocket.”</p><p>She also claimed he “gifted” her two expensive cars paid for from her own bank account, and when the broke up, the cars “disappeared.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYmiDcX6SaKCnq5mZsm7AxJ6lZqWfonqiucGeqWaon6fBuLvOnWSsoKWpwaa%2BxJ1km62jnrumv9KeqmappZ7Bbr%2FHqK5o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-teen-mom-amber-portwood-shuttered-businesses-quit-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finside-teen-mom-amber-portwood-shuttered-businesses-quit-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finside-teen-mom-amber-portwood-shuttered-businesses-quit-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finside-teen-mom-amber-portwood-shuttered-businesses-quit-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-teen-mom-amber-portwood-shuttered-businesses-quit-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-teen-mom-amber-portwood-shuttered-businesses-quit-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shep-rose-and-taylor-ann-green-its-over-after-2-years-because-he-wants-to-sleep-around.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shep-rose-and-taylor-ann-green-its-over-after-2-years-because-he-wants-to-sleep-around.html>It's Over!

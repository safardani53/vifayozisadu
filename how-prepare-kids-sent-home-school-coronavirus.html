will I still get paid?</h2><p>Parents are entitled to take time off work to look after their children without facing disciplinary action or losing their job.</p><p>This is known as "dependent leave" which allows the parent time off to deal with an unexpected problem or emergency.</p><p>The downside is that you won't be paid for the time off, unless your employer specifically says that you will.</p><p>You may be able to negotiate taking holiday with your employer if you'd still like to get paid and are entitled to paid holiday but this will be at their discretion.</p><p>But crucially, you don’t have to make the missed time up later on.</p><p>You can take off upto 18 weeks' unpaid leave before your child is 18.</p><p>Tracey Moss, employment expert at Citizens Advice, said that if your employer won’t give you time off, or has disciplined you for having to look after your child, contact your nearest Citizens Advice for help.&nbsp;<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000567758046-1.jpg><h2>Do I need to stockpile?</h2><p>If you and your family are forced to isolate at home, there are plenty of options for stockpiling.&nbsp;</p><p>The government is advising that it's okay to have friends or family drop off supplies, and there's always the possibility of getting shopping delivered.</p><p>Although with<a href=#> Ocado warning of delays</a>, you may have to get by for a few days without your online shopping.</p><p>For people with plenty of cash, takeaways are also an option, though services may be busier than usual.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Household essentials stockpile checklist</h3></p><p>HERE'S some of the things you're likely to need for a two-week quarantine</p><ul><li>toothpaste</li><li>soap/ handwash</li><li>shower gel</li><li>tampons and sanitary towels</li><li>toilet roll</li><li>washing detergent</li><li>candles/flashlight</li><li>basic medicines – headaches, cold and flu, hayfever, coughs, plus any essentials you take regularly</li><li>batteries</li><li>bin bags</li><li>bleach, surface cleaner and other cleaning products</li><li>cling film and / or foil</li><li>nappies, baby wipes and other baby essentials</li></ul><h3>What should you stockpile if you are self-isolated?</h3><p>The most obvious thing to stock up on is food.</p><p>Obvious things to include are staples such as pasta and rice, but you'll also want flavourings and spices, vegetables and good sources of protein.</p><p>Long shelf-life is key here. There's no point stocking up on fresh meat, fruit or vegetables that will go off before you need them.</p><p>It's also worth making sure you have some household essentials set aside.</p><p>After all, while you could live without any toilet roll, you'd probably rather not have to.</p><p>Other obvious things to consider are medicines, bathroom essentials, and laundry products.</p><p>Think about things you personally may not wish to run out of, for instance contact lenses, toothpaste or shampoo.</p><p>For more advice,<a href=#> see our guide on stockpiling.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NINTCHDBPICT000564302986.jpg><h3>How to keep kids entertained if they are home from schools</h3><p>Many schools are looking into whether students can work from home, with one UK school having a training day to ensure staff can teach pupils remotely through “virtual education”.&nbsp;</p><p>Some schools are also looking into work booklets that can be produced to be sent home with children.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also being discussed if pupils could be forced to sit their<a href=#> GCSE or A-level tests</a> in the summer holidays if the deadly bug holds the nation hostage.</p><p>If you are looking for some ways to entertain your kids when they aren’t studying, why not opt for these household activities:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Bake some tasty treats. You can’t go wrong with a batch of chocolate Rice Krispie cakes. All you need is Rice Krispies and chocolate of their choice.&nbsp;</li><li>Make an indoor cinema with homemade popcorn and blankets.&nbsp;</li><li>Help your kids get creative with some arts and crafts.&nbsp;</li><li>Whack out the board games and put their skills to the test.&nbsp;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AG-BORIS-CORONAVIRUS-ACTIONPLANS-v3.jpg><h2>Why have some schools closed in the UK?</h2><p>The main reason that schools have cited for closing their doors has been to prevent the spread and keep staff and pupils safe.</p><p>Two schools closed following staff members who had recently returned from Italy, where the virus is<a href=#> spreading rapidly</a>.</p><p>The ContinU Plus Academy in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, closed when a staff member was in "close contact" with a family member who was self-isolating after being in northern Italy.</p><p>William Martin Church of England Junior, Infant and Nursery School in Harlow, Essex shut its doors for the same reason.</p><p>Another top independent school Cransley School in Northwich, Cheshire closed after a number of students and staff who went on a ski trip to northern Italy over half-term began to show flu-like symptoms.</p><p>Dulwich Prep School in south London also took the decision to close.&nbsp;<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000568545522.jpg><h2>Can you work from home or request flexible working?</h2><p>All employees have the right to request flexible working -

The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off actor</a>, 67, was involved in a collision that took place near the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday, October 31, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;The eyewitness, who is a nearby restaurant owner, told the outlet that Alan was very concerned that everyone else was safe.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Two people were reportedly injured in the crash, but they were both breathing, and no pedestrians were hit during the accident. TMZ also reported that there was “no indication of DUI.” The eyewitness told&nbsp;ET&nbsp;that Alan was immediately worried if someone had been injured. ” I went over to the car and I asked Alan, ‘Are you OK?’ And first thing that he said to me was, ‘Is everyone OK? Did I hit anybody? Did anybody get hurt?'” he said. “And I said, ‘I don’t know.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alan-ruck-car-crash-ok-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Police said that they didn’t believe that drugs or alcohol were involved in the crash, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News.</a> The restaurant owner also said that he spoke to Alan himself, and he seemed fine. “He actually seemed perfectly OK. There were no issues that I could see. The police officer checked him out,” he said. “He was very coherent. He talked with me like everything was fine. He was immediately concerned throughout the entire time, just concerned with everybody else, which I really appreciate.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The eyewitness also said that after reviewing the footage, he realized that they were lucky no one had been hit. “If it was one second earlier, there was people in the crosswalk that would’ve gotten hit. It was just unbelievable and no one got seriously injured,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>After the crash, a 32-year-old man was hospitalized, and the building was sectioned off with yellow tape, due to structural damage. The pizza place was not open on Wednesday, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>KTLA</a>. The pizzeria owner,&nbsp;<strong>Walter Rosales,&nbsp;</strong>told CBS News that many patrons were emotional. “It was really hard last night, all the people that were crying … because they know to us, they know for so many years, they were crying and giving thanks to God because we were alive,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49rZpqkkaN6s8HCpGSsnZWisqV5zqRkmp6kmr9ur8CrZJyqkai1brHYnq6irJ6awLR50pqwrGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falan-ruck-seemed-ok-after-car-crash-eyewitness-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2falan-ruck-seemed-ok-after-car-crash-eyewitness-says.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2falan-ruck-seemed-ok-after-car-crash-eyewitness-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2falan-ruck-seemed-ok-after-car-crash-eyewitness-says.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falan-ruck-seemed-ok-after-car-crash-eyewitness-says.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2falan-ruck-seemed-ok-after-car-crash-eyewitness-says.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./emmerdale-alex-lincoln-soap-return-jamie-tate.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./emmerdale-alex-lincoln-soap-return-jamie-tate.html>Emmerdales Alex Lincoln breaks silence on soap return - revealing talks with bosses desperate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./why-are-people-leaving-shania-twain-concerts.html>Why Are People Leaving Shania Twain Concerts?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./why-are-people-leaving-shania-twain-concerts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

Like any good creepy story on the internet, you should read these accounts and decide for yourself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">MIB description: black suits, no expressions, and zero personality.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Allegedly, all people who've claimed to have been in contact with the Men in Black have either researched or seen UFOs.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><p>Most people's stories describe their interactions with the Men in Black as being very similar: the "faceless" men approaching them say they're a member of some type of organization and present white cards that read "Security". They refer to each other by numbers, not names. They also claim that MIB often times intimidate and scare people into keeping quiet about their extraterrestrial sightings and research.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. The first man to report an encounter with the MIB was Harold Dahl in 1947.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Dahl was apparently out on his boat in the Puget Sound in Washington when six &nbsp;circular objects appeared in the sky. One of the objects apparently fell apart. The ensuing debris struck his ship, which ended up injuring his son and killing his dog.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dahl said he snapped photos of the debris, but a Man in Black fogged over his pictures and told him to never speak of what happened ever again.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. The second official record comes 20 years later, by Robert Richardson in Toledo, Ohio.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: youtube</span></figure><p>Richardson was driving home one night when he claims that he hit a UFO with his car. The flying object vanished, but Richardson had a piece of metal from the UFO stuck to his car. He fished the metal out of his car and claims that a week later some men in black suits appeared at his door and asked for the metal he had saved from the crash.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When Richardson informed them that he gave the metal to the authorities already for testing, they threatened his wife.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: youtube</span></figure>"If you want your wife to stay as pretty as she is, then you'd better get the metal back."<p>He never heard from them again nor did he know how they discovered the metal ever existed in the first place.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Jack Robinson - 1968: a New Jersey resident claims him and his wife were constantly being harassed by a man in a black suit.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Robinson was a UFO researcher, who reported that his apartment was rummaged through and there would be a man in a black suit and hat who would constantly be standing outside of his apartment. The couple's friend, Timothy Green Beckley, managed to snap a photo of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">man in black as he was waiting outside.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. 1976 - Dr. Herbert Hopkins another UFO researcher, gets a call from someone who claimed to be a rep from a NJ UFO organization.</h2><p>The man asked if Hopkins was alone and would like to discuss his research, Hopkins said sure and they talked about what he had found. By the time Hopkins hung up the phone, a man was at his doorstep. Hopkins described the man as being bald without eyebrows wearing a neatly tailored suit. He had red lips and very, very white skin.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What the MIB "agent" did next is where things get truly creepy. He took a coin out of his pocket and told Hopkins to watch it.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @journeyman_nyc</a></p></figure>"it started to develop a silver color instead of copper and then the silver became bluish and the penny was getting quite fuzzy, out of focus, blurred, and then it simply was gone â€“ it slowly dematerialized."<p>After that happened, the man ordered that Hopkins destroy all of his research.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Dan Akroyd's Sci-Fi series gets mysteriously canceled mid-shoot.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The Blues Brothers star had a series called Out There that he sold to the Sci Fi channel. It dealt with crop circles, UFOs, alien abductions, and all type of extraterrestrial research.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The actor recounts his chilling experience with a Man in Black.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>While taking a break from interviews on an episode of the show, Akroyd stepped outside and saw, across a busy New York street, a man in a black suit standing outside a black Ford sedan. When Akroyd looked away for a second and looked back, the sedan was gone. What's really strange is that two hours after spotting a MIB, Akroyd was told by producers that they were instructed to stop filming (mid-shoot, mind you) and the show was canceled.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. The 2008 Shane Sovar Hotel Incident&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Sovar, Manager at a Niagara Falls hotel along with a security guard reported seeing a triangular UFO outside their building. A group called the Aerial Phenomenon Investigations Team responded to the incident. That team and three other witnesses report that some weeks later, two Men in Black entered the hotel. Allegedly they scared the staff at the hotel and asked for Sovar and the Security Guard, who weren't present at the time.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The men were described as tall with identical faces that had no eyebrows or eyelashes and really, really pale skin.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7.

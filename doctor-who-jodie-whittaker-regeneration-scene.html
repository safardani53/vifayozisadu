<time>14 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>SHE’S had mixed success playing Doctor Who – so it's no great surprise to learn Jodie Whittaker may NOT be seen regenerating into her successor when her final moments as the Time Lord air later this year.</p><p>I understand the BBC1 show’s new team are considering having a break, for a complete reboot, between Jodie’s final episodes as the doctor and her yet-to-be-revealed replacement hopping aboard the Tardis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000669291365-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000453682140.jpg><p>Following the conclusion of the show’s latest series in December, Jodie filmed a New Year’s Day special and she will star in two more later this year before signing off.</p><p>But the possible reboot means the show’s first ever female Doctor, who has been in the role since 2017, may be denied her farewell regeneration scene.</p><p>Jodie’s New Year’s Day outing as Doctor Who drew just 3.4million viewers — the show’s lowest ever rating since 2005.</p><p>Now, bosses are mulling things over. A TV insider says: “The new team are considering a range of radical options in a bid to revive the flagging fortunes of a programme which is adored by millions around the world.</p><p>“That could see them take the decision to put space between Jodie’s time in the Tardis and that of her successor. Which means she may not be seen regenerating into the next doctor. She has already wrapped filming on this year’s special episodes, and a new Time Lord has yet to be revealed.”</p><p>Although the move seems radical, it was one taken by show boss Russell T. Davies when Doctor Who was relaunched in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston in the title role. He was not seen emerging from a regeneration, and the batch of 21st-century series were intended as a clear break from the Doctor’s adventures in the Eighties. Though he was eventually seen regenerating from the late John Hurt's doctor in a much later episode.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Speculation over who will be the next Time Lord has been rife and Russell insists the audition process began just a few weeks ago.</p><p>The bookies’ favourites include three stars of Channel 4 drama It’s A Sin — Lydia West, Years & Years singer Olly Alexander and Omari Douglas.</p><p>A show spokeswoman would only say: “There are lots of exciting plans in store but viewers are just going to have to wait and see”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Sneaky sneakers, Davina</h2><p>SHE sparkled in an £800 purple-and-orange glittery gown on The Masked Singer – but underneath the judges’ desk Davina McCall was wearing something far more comfortable.</p><p>She posted on Instagram this snap of her backstage at the ITV show and revealed she had teamed her glam gown with a pair of box-fresh trainers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000706958279.jpg><p>Davina told her 1.4million followers: “Must say, quite enjoyed trainers and posh dresses.”</p><p>She has been forced to ditch her heels for more comfy footwear during the past few weeks after hurting her ankle when she fell over running.</p><p>Take it from me, Davina, life is far more fun when you take it at a slower pace – and a lot less dangerous.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>BRUNCH LEAVES BAD TASTE, GUYS</h2><p>SUNDAY Brunch hosts <a href=#>Tim Lovejoy</a> and Simon Rimmer came under fire on yesterday’s C4 show after revealing new segment Pet ER.</p><p>They wore white coats and showed photos of viewers’ unwell pets. But rather than being amusing it angered many viewers.</p><p>One messaged: “You want people to send in photos of their ‘ill and no longer here’ pets so you can make fun of them for your entertainment?”</p><p>Another added: “This is dreadful. Who in their right mind decided to show poorly pets and take the pee. What is it next – which ones died?” Best just stick to the cooking, guys.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">'HOT PRIEST'</h3></p><p><strong>FLEABAG star ANDREW SCOTT, the BBC comedy’s “hot priest”, seems to have rekindled his romance with writer Stephen Beresford.</strong></p><p>The pair, who were together for a decade before their split in 2019, were spotted in Venice, Italy, over the weekend.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>BEWARE McFLY IN THE SOUP</h2><p>HE is no stranger to appearing on the box and has been a coach on The Voice Kids UK since 2017.</p><p>But now McFLY guitarist Danny Jones is trying his hand at a cooking show. The musician has signed up to take part in the latest series of BBC1’s Celebrity MasterChef.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000696696756.jpg><p>An insider said: “Danny has been cooking up a storm for Gregg Wallace and John Torode.</p><p>“Fans might not know but he is a pretty decent chef and he has really impressed. Obviously the pressure in that kitchen is like nothing Danny has experienced before but he has really shone.”</p><p>I certainly hope he has more luck with his utensils than his drummer bandmate Harry Judd did when he appeared on ITV’s Cooking With The Stars last year and cut off the end of his finger.</p><p>At least Harry had something to remember the show by.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>LISA’S SO LUVVERLY BARBELLY</h2><p>LISA SNOWDON has suggested a maybe surprising way for women in their fifties to stay healthy – pumping iron.</p><p>The resident fashion expert on ITV’s This Morning is a contributor to the daytime show’s Fab at 50 segment, appearing today from 10am.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8c6bf1b2-7642-4bcb-89c6-546d9b28e405.jpg><p>Asked how she keeps fit and well, Lisa, who turned 50 yesterday, says: “Weight training. That has been a really good tip somebody gave me a couple of years ago.</p><p>“As we get older we need to protect our bones, get stronger muscles, and it really helps us to burn fat. It makes you feel good and feel strong.”</p><p>She also reckons: “Movement is medicine... a lovely long walk out in nature, taking time just for you, being mindful, looking around you, listening to the birds, taking in nature.”</p><p>I’d take the walk over the weights, I reckon.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ROB: IT’S ALL CONE TOO FAR</h2><p>ROB BECKETT has finally admitted what most of us suspected all along – that he was only joking when he said he was Traffic Cone on The Masked Singer.</p><p>When the comic made his claim last week it was rightly treated as dubious, not least because it would have been a huge spoiler for the ITV show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000685118723.jpg><p>But just to remove any nagging doubt in our minds, this weekend he tweeted: “Right, so I have a confession. I’m not Traffic Cone.</p><p>"It’s a wind-up. However it’s got so out of hand the actual Traffic Cone has angrily messaged me telling me to stop saying I’m Traffic Cone. So for the record, I’m not Traffic Cone. But I now know who is.”</p><p>Hmmmm. I wonder if it might be Rob’s old mate and fellow funnyman Romesh Ranga-Nathan?</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>HURRY UP WITH THE SHERI, DO</h2><p>SHE’S had more experiences in the past year than most of us do in a lifetime – which may be why Sheridan Smith has pushed back the release of her autobiography.</p><p>It was scheduled to come out in October but is still nowhere to be seen. Which may be because she feels the candid book, entitled Honestly, should feature some of the more recent changes to her world.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000690938484.jpg><p>Sheridan turned 40 in June, then separated from her fiancé, former insurance broker Jamie Horn, who is the dad of their son Billy. Then she started dating an old flame, split from him and had a car crash.</p><p>Her work life is just as busy. She has just starred in BBC1 true- crime drama Four Lives, and is about to appear in ITV thriller No Return, as well as Channel 5 drama The Teacher, which starts next Monday. Maybe she should just release Honestly now and save the past year’s events for a sequel this summer.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Doctor Who returns with Jodie Whittaker in CGI-heavy opening scene</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSBdn6Tbm1qZ5SksLW70Wauoaddn7yltcRmrqGhpKmurLHRZqmen5WjsrOt06Kmp2WjmLKvsY4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoctor-who-jodie-whittaker-regeneration-scene.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harland-carl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harland-carl.html>Harland Carl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./was-marilyn-monroe-mexican.html>Was Marilyn Monroe Mexican?

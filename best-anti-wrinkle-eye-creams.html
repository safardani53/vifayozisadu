<time>01 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Puffy bags, enhanced wrinkles and dark circles; nothing reveals ageing more than eyes that appear dull and lack brightness.</p><p>Unfortunately as we age, the skin around our eyes starts to thin and break down as our collagen depletes, and the first thing we notice is that eyes look tired, lose their sparkle and the fine lines and wrinkles appear even more defined.</p><p>The good news is that if you add one of the best anti-ageing eye creams into your skincare routine, you can transform the delicate skin area and over time help return its youthful glow. To make a visible difference however, you really need to know what you are looking for.</p><p>The anti-ageing market is saturated with products, so the best anti-ageing eye creams need to have hero ingredients that will help drive results. These include retinol, a wonder ingredient that is used in skincare because of its ability to speed up skin cell renewal and enhance collagen production; vitamin C, which helps brighten skin; and hyaluronic acid, which is known for its skin plumping properties.</p><p>If you're stuck on where to start, we've helped you get your eyes on the prize with a tried-and-tested round-up of our favourite anti-ageing eye products.</p><h2>Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/13467794-1064925489983359.jpg><ul><li><strong>Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream, £45 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>As one of the most reputable European cosmetic brands on the market, Clinique is a skincare giant that prides itself on its clinical approach to beauty. So when it launched its latest eye care product in December, it was no surprise to discover it packs a punch.</p><p>While all good eye creams will deliver much-needed hydration and moisture to a delicate area over time, this feels as though it works instantly. This is no doubt down to its key ingredient, CL1870 Peptide Complex (the holy grail of skincare), which works in a similar way to Botox – but smooths the skin naturally.</p><p>With just a small dot of the cream, the eye area feels instantly firmer and it is so light that it sinks into the skin without leaving any residue, meaning it doesn’t interfere if you choose to apply make-up straight over it.</p><p>As this is a new eye cream and we’ve only been trialling it for four weeks, we were surprised to see fast-driven results. The eye area became more bright and radiant as the dead skin cells were removed and the effect meant fine lines in the corner of our reviewer’s eyes seemed to reduce. Puffy eyes are also targeted by the cream’s botanical ingredients that act as a calming barrier to help reduce inflammation.</p><p>This is definitely a product worth eyeing up, and although the price point is middle-of-the-road, a small amount goes a very long way!</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>Bloom & Halo Eye Need Dew</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/147r9e4fpelm3jytr3yyrd6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/image-37new.jpg><ul><li><strong>Bloom & Halo Eye Need Dew, £18 from Bloom & Halo - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>There’s so much to love about this newish skincare brand that we don’t know where to start. First up, out of all the eye products on the market, this is by far one of the best looking when it comes to packaging. The retro recycling box is as cool as the products themselves: 30 pairs of Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol & Collagen Eye Patches that are designed to provide hydration to the delicate eye area.</p><p>With Hyaluronic Acid being the focus of everything the brand sells, reducing fluid retention is one of its main targets, and these patches infuse the skin with a perfect mixture of ingredients.<br>Used on the eye area for 10 to 15 minutes, you can feel them going to work, leaving skin feeling dewier.</p><p>We like to put these on first thing in the morning to revitalise our eyes, and the cooling sensation (it is advised to put them in the fridge) provides a great wake up call. They really help to bring down any puffiness thanks to the Vitamin C addition, and skin feels smooth and soft.</p><h2>Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/13028436-2514918742523228.jpg><ul><li><strong>Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Concentrate Matrix, £54 from LookFantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This is a cult favourite and with very good reason. With the hyaluronic acid hit, along with the addition of some anti-ageing big guns including peptides, glycerine and sodium hyaluronate, this powerful product is specially formulated to attack wrinkles by firming and tightening the skin around the eye.</p><p>We’ve been using it for years and although it doesn’t necessarily keep wrinkles at bay, it definitely softens the skin and makes them look less prominent.</p><p>Our favourite aspect of this product is its cooling cryo-steel wand that allows you to instantly de-puff the skin as you glide it gently across your eye area. It cools on contact and allows the cream to absorb beautifully into the skin, rather than sit on the outer layer.</p><p>The big sell of this cream is that it claims to reduce dark circles under the eyes in just three weeks and we have been using it long enough to agree. The formula’s magic properties help repair the skin at night, encouraging the production of fresh skin cells which help visibly reduce signs of dark circles and ageing.</p><h2>Temple Spa Eye Truffle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tcrnbekl.cdn.imgeng.in/media/catalog/product/cache/165dd36597f219677c634951ef51c09f/e/y/eye_truffle_carton_side_thumb_2020_1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Temple Spa Eye Truffle, £65 from Temple Spa - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Black summer truffles and champagne extract; you could be forgiven for thinking you are at a luxurious summer banquet. However, they are ingredients that work just as well on your skin as your taste buds.</p><p>Temple Spa’s eye truffle is a cream that, together with the all-important peptides, creates a smooth texture that literally melts into the skin. In fact, it feels a bit like you are rubbing whipped cream into your skin.</p><p>Although wrinkles are targeted by this eye truffle, what really stands out is that it completely covers up dark circles. It is almost like you have put an eraser to the skin, such is the magic of the formula.</p><p>The secret, it seems, lies in the black truffles, which are rich in amino acids and known to aid collagen production, giving firmer and smoother skin and diminishing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>With the addition of a diamond illuminating powder that has natural exfoliants to help brighten skin, this will get you all-a-flutter.</p><h2>Sunday Riley 5 Stars Retinoid and Niacinamide Eye Serum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.spacenk.com/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-spacenkmastercatalog/default/dw3e77bb54/products/SUNDAY/UK300057257_SUNDAY.jpg><ul><li><strong>Sunday Riley 5 Stars Retinoid and Niacinamide Eye Serum, £60 from SpaceNK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>A serum that boasts five stars in its name has to be pretty confident in delivering the goods. And once you have used Sunday Riley’s 5 Stars Retinoid, you’ll understand why!</p><p>This eye serum can only be described as lush. Whatever eye issue you have, be it red skin or dark circles, sore eyelids, fine lines or just tired-looking eyes, this targets all problems. One warning though: use sparingly! As with all products containing retinol, a tiny amount is all you need.</p><p>Out of all the products we tested, this proved the most enjoyable to apply. The gel texture glides onto the skin via a cool rounded applicator that is shaped to smooth it into the skin. Almost immediately you can feel the retinol going to work, and the cooling sensation of the metal against skin helps make it feel ultra-hydrating and refreshing.</p><p>It is also infused with poppy seed extract and ceramides to smooth the eye area and ingredients including olive oil and shea butter give a big rehydration boost to the skin. Wave bye bye to dry eyes.<br>Expensive, but well worth the price.</p><h2>Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.ctfassets.net/wlke2cbybljx/7Jy0X3DcusVULtSpMdyhx8/5add17aab9ea8e4a86cec11ee425ac77/Magic-Eye-Rescue-Open-Lid.png><ul><li><strong>Charlotte Tilbury Magic Eye Rescue, £42 from Charlotte Tilbury - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Make up and wake up with beauty guru Charlotte Tilbury who, unsurprisingly, has her eye on the ball when it comes to skincare. Just like her make-up range, this beautifully designed chunky octagonal jar with a rose-gold lid oozes elegance and luxury.</p><p>Unlike other eye care products, this feels quite thick when applied. The buttery formula (created with ingredients including plant stem cells, algae and peptides) does initially feel quite heavy on the skin but absorbs well. It’s super hydrating and we found it to be a real rescue remedy when used after a night of little sleep, as it seemed to brighten the eye contour area and remove any dry patches.</p><p>We’ve been an avid user of this product on and off over the years and it remains one of our top picks; eyes look less puffy, skin is firmer and under-eye fine lines are well targeted, appearing softer after a few weeks.</p><h2>Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.thcdn.com/images/large/webp//productimg/1600/1600/12453085-1604897173812751.jpg><ul><li><strong>Murad Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum, £65 from Cult Beauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>It is the retinol in this eye serum that produces such fantastic results in waging a war with wrinkles and fine lines. Murad is a powerhouse brand that does exactly what it says on the tin; helping eyes appear brighter and more youthful. By stimulating the production of collagen, a tiny use of this retinol serum works wonders.</p><p>You only need to rub on a fingertip of serum for it to work its magic. Too much can produce redness, but we found it extremely gentle on the eye area. The fact it is ideal for sensitive skin makes it a good all-rounder, too.</p><p>We found zero irritation when using this daily, and we’re not surprised it is the brand’s best-seller — reportedly, 93% of users see a reduction in lines and wrinkles in just four weeks. There’s no denying that this serum is expensive, but you’ve got to see it to believe it, and it lasts a very long time.</p><p>Within two weeks of using it, the under eye area felt less sandy and well hydrated. This really is the apple of our eye!</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE FROM SUN SELECTS BEAUTY</h2></p><p>Don't forget to give the rest of your face a little anti-ageing love, with the best <a href=#>anti-wrink</a><a href=#>le</a><a href=#> creams</a> of 2022.</p><p>Enjoyed our roundup of the best anti-wrinkle eye creams?

We do not commit crime.”</p><p>Mr McCready told how he stopped any alleged wayward youths on his camp at Merw Meadows on Mere Lane, which has 42 pitches, by getting them reprimanded.</p><p>He told public inquiry Inspector Ms Karen Taylor, sitting at the council’s HQ The Symington Building in Market Harborough, Leics, that he felt he had support from some villagers and local beat police officers.</p><p>We take nothing from society, we are good people, law abiding and we are not trouble makers. We do not commit crime</p><span class=quote-credit>Tracy McCready</span><p>The dad, who did not give his age, said it was unfair to tarnish the traveller community with criminal activity and anti-social behaviour - saying it was a misconception.</p><p>He explained that any possible wrongdoers were in “a minority not a majority.”</p><p>He added: “I do understand peoples’ worries but getting rid of good people to make way for bad people is not our way.”</p><p>Mr McCready, who appears to the father figure in the camp where he has lived for 14 years and where he owns the biggest plots, said: “If kids on the camp misbehave, if there’s any problem we sort it.”</p><p>He told of one situation where “a kid robbed a stamp” from the local post office and after complaints he made the parents go down and “pay for that stamp.”</p><p>When asked by the appeal inspector how failing to win planning permission would affect his family life, he replied: “It would have a big impact on family life.</p><p>"This is our family home and we want to provide for all members."</p><p>He told how his son had recently married and would want to have children, and how his teenage boys needed their own space and caravan as they grew up.</p><p>He said he had four cousins living on the site, plus their parents and kids, a brother-in-law and his parents and “quite a number of other cousins.”</p><p>He added: “You need a home for your family and we need more space for ours.”</p><p>He told how his sons enjoyed soccer and one went to church, saying: “Yes, gypsies play football and go to church.</p><p>“We integrate with the community.”</p><p>But he explained his kids didn’t go to local schools as they were home schooled.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>It comes as <a href=#>mum-of-five Amy Gentle dispelled myths that travellers don't pay tax</a>, they always want to live on the road and that they leave a trail of rubbish behind them.</p><p><a href=#>And she vowed never to hide who she really is</a> -

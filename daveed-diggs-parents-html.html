He is also well recognized for his work in the 2020 television adaptation of Snowpiecer. Additionally,&nbsp;his&nbsp;work in the 2015 Broadway musical Hamilton is still talked about. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The talented entertainer is also active in the industry as a rapper, singer, songwriter, screenwriter, and producer.&nbsp;In his music career, Diggs is the lead vocalist in the experimental hip hop group, Clipping.&nbsp;</p><h2>Getting to Know Daveed Diggs</h2><p>Diggs was born in Oakland, California on January 24, 1982, as the son of Barbara Diggs and Dountes Diggs. His mother has a background in social work, while his dad is an experienced bus driver.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A young Diggs attended Berkeley High School and later graduated from Brown University in 2004 with a bachelor's degree in theater.</p><p>Talking about his parents, the actor's mother, Barbara, belongs to a Jewish heritage while his father, Dountes, is African-American.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2015, the actor opened up about his childhood, acting inspirations, family, and culture during his exclusive <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Broadway</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Firstly, Diggs talked about growing up as a poor shy kid with an affinity for acting.</p><p>In the chat, the actor talked about how from an early age, he&nbsp;"liked being on stage"&nbsp;because it gave him "a reason to be around people."&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Diggs gave his insight into what acting&nbsp;always meant to him and said, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The other great thing about acting is it allows you to imagine circumstances different from your own. I was a poor Bay Area kid getting to pretend to be a Russian aristocrat.</p><p>Diggs, who belongs to a family of mixed races, never felt the cultures to be separate while growing up in his household.</p><p>Additionally, during his youth, Diggs identified himself as Jewish, but at the same time embraced his father's culture as well.</p><p>In the conversation, the actor/singer also talked about having many friends from mixed cultures during his early youth years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, despite identifying his roots and embracing his <a href=# rel=follow>Jewish culture</a> and religion in his early life, the multi-talented actor did not have a Bar Mitzvah (a coming of age ceremony for Jewish boys when they are the age of 12 or 13). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Black-Jewish Representation through Music</h2><p>In 2020, Diggs teamed with Disney and collaborated with his Clipping members William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes for the holiday song 'Puppy for Hanukkah.'</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, Diggs “was honored" after being approached by&nbsp;Disney Channel to do a&nbsp;"fresh Hanukkah tune." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>For the singer, it was an opportunity to share his love of music and give everyone "a little piece of my culture.”</p><p>The song is about a young boy who is desperately hoping to get a puppy as his Hanukkah present.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The song became an instant hit, and the song's official music video has amassed 1,460,800 views as of this writing.</p><p>Hanukkah is a Jewish festival&nbsp;celebrated among the Jewish community. The festival begins in late November and ends in the first week of December, comprising eight nights and days.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The festive period is widely considered to be the Festival of Lights or the Feast of Dedication.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the song, singer Diggs paid tribute to his Jewish roots, sharing a part of his culture and the religion he's learned to practice through his mother.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRq7KmsIydoKCfo2K9or7Ep6usZpipuq0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdaveed-diggs-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdaveed-diggs-parents-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdaveed-diggs-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdaveed-diggs-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdaveed-diggs-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdaveed-diggs-parents-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mike-dunleavy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mike-dunleavy.html>Mike Dunleavy Bio: NBA &amp;amp; Net Worth [ 2023 Update]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./keith-ape.html>Keith Ape- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./keith-ape.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

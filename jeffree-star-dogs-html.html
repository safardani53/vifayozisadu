<time>22 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Anyone who knows about <a href=# rel=follow>Jeffree Star</a> associates him with two things - makeup and dogs.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Star adores animals and has confessed that he loves them&nbsp;more than he loves people. Looking at his videos and Instagram, it is evident that he loves his fur babies a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>He currently has&nbsp;seven Pomeranians who live with him at his Wyoming ranch.&nbsp;Previously, they all&nbsp;lived in his $14 million Hidden Hills mansion.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Star is obsessed with his pets and travels around the world with them. All of his dogs'&nbsp;names start with the letter 'D.'</p><p>Moreover,&nbsp;he&nbsp;even named&nbsp;some of his lipsticks after them. He also launched another brand named Jeffree Star Pets, where his fur babies model&nbsp;for&nbsp;toys and accessories.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He had pets since he was young and got his first Pomeranian during his MySpace Era.&nbsp;Since he has been in the limelight, Star has had nine dogs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here is everything about his four-legged babies.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Jeffree Star with Diamond. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Jeffree Star's First Dog â€” Diamond</h2><p>Star's first dog's name was Diamond. She was a white Pomeranian that had&nbsp;been with the beauty mogul since he was an influencer on MySpace.</p><p>He often gushed how Diamond had&nbsp;been a crucial part of his life. Similarly, he often mentioned how Diamond had been with him through his life changes.&nbsp;</p><p>This was because she went from&nbsp;traveling all over the USA on a tour bus with Star when he was a musician to traveling in a private jet when he was a millionaire.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Diamond has her lipstick shade, which was a part of The Star Family Collection of Jeffree Star Cosmetics.&nbsp;Star was very attached to his first fur baby and was devastated when Diamond passed away.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He announced her death <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via Instagram</a> and YouTube.&nbsp;In June 2019, he made a video with his then-boyfriend, Nathan Schwandt, dedicated to Diamond.&nbsp;</p><h2>Diva&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Diva is Star's oldest pup out of the seven. He is a tan Pomeranian who turned 12 as of April 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Since he is old, he often gets sick. Star keeps his fans updated about his fur baby's health via Instagram and Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Jeffree Star with his dogs for the promotional shoot of his pet brand.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In 2020, Star revealed that Diva had cancer via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a YouTube video</a> titled, 'I Have Some REALLY Bad News.'&nbsp;However, after the operation, cancer seems&nbsp;to be under control.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He opted not to go for the Radiation Chemotherapy for Diva&nbsp;because the surgery activated diabetes. As a result, Diva has to get "Vetsulin" injections every morning and night.&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst Diva's medical complications, Star was once accused of mistreatment by people on Twitter. However, he <a href=# rel="follow noopener">slammed the critics</a> and said Diva was ill because of his age, not mistreatment.&nbsp;</p><h2>Daddy&nbsp;</h2><p>Star got Daddy, a wolf-sable Pomeranian, when he was still with&nbsp;Schwandt. He often shared that Daddy was more like Schwandt's baby than his.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>This was because Schwandt had trained Daddy and slept with him when he was young. Unfortunately, Daddy is no more.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple lost him a couple of weeks after Diamond's death. They announced Daddy passing away in October 2020.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Star has pointed out in the past that losing two dogs took a toll on his mental health and relationship with Schwandt.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Drama, Delicious, and Da Vinci</h2><p>Drama is Star's five-year-old Pomeranian, who looks very similar to Diva. The beauty mogul got Drama in 2018 and celebrates her&nbsp;birthday every year on Halloween.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Jeffree Star with his dogs.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>He has given Drama his last name and&nbsp;often calls&nbsp;her "Drama Lynn."&nbsp;Delicious is Star's only pure black Pomeranian. He also has&nbsp;the name 'Delicious' tattooed on his neck.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Delicious is often seen arguing with Star's other dog, Da Vinci. He was the last dog the YouTuber got with Schwandt.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pair announced</a> getting Da Vinci on Star's YouTube channel. He&nbsp;lovingly calls Da Vinci "Vinch" and often films the dog peeing since "Vinch" pees while doing a headstand.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Delicious and Da Vinci are the most active of all the other dogs.</p><h2>Dessert, Dominatrix and&nbsp;Donatella</h2><p>Dessert, Dominatrix, and Donatella are the newcomers to the Star family. Star got Dessert and Dominatrix together in April 2020. Dominatrix or "Dommy"&nbsp;looks exactly like Daddy, since the two are related.&nbsp;</p><p>Donatella is the beauty mogul's last dog, who he got in June 2021. As usual, he also announced Donatella's arrival on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>However, unlike his other dogs, Donatella did not get to stay in L.A. for a long time. Before she came, Star had already planned to move to his Wyoming ranch, so he took Donatella there.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKVm7OzscRmqq2ZomKxsLPSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeffree-star-dogs-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeffree-star-dogs-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeffree-star-dogs-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeffree-star-dogs-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeffree-star-dogs-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeffree-star-dogs-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./man-covered-with-tattoos-loses-job-kindergarten-teacher-scares-students.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./man-covered-with-tattoos-loses-job-kindergarten-teacher-scares-students.html>Man Covered with Tattoos Loses Job as a Kindergarten Teacher After Scaring Student</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./claudia-lennear.html>Fame | Claudia Lennear net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./claudia-lennear.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

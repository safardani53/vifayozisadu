Celebrity news/gossip Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>DeuxMoi</a> claimed in April 2023 that Kylie is Timothée’s “new girl.” Plus, they were <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted</a> hanging out at <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paris Fashion Week</a>. Not only was the makeup mogul’s car reportedly<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;seen at&nbsp;</a>the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dune&nbsp;star</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>‘s </a>house, but a source confirmed they were seeing each other casually in an April 17 report for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “They are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>keeping things casual</a> at this point. It’s not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothée and seeing where it goes,” the person claimed at the time. “It’s been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships. It’s new and exciting for Kylie and she’s having a lot of fun.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>While the recent Beyoncé concert marks the first time that they’ve attended a public event together, Kylie and Timothée have been seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spending time together</a> with friends, like when they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attended a friend’s barbecue</a> in June. Plus the Kylie Cosmetics founder’s car has been seen parked in front of the actor’s mansion on a few occasions, and the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> two of them were seen leaving</a> in Aug. 2023. While there had been some rumors that they broke up, it appears that their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romance is going well,</a> especially after they were seen locking lips at the Beyoncé show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The romance comes a few months after Kylie and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her on-and-off boyfriend</a> since 2017 and the father of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her two kids</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>, split. Travis did not appear to be happy about their romance. In July 2023 he dropped his fifth studio album, Utopia, and fans are certain a song on the record called “MELTDOWN” takes a shot at Timothée by mentioning Willy Wonka, and then daring someone thought to be Kylie to find someone more attractive than him. Timothée, of course, played Willy Wonka in the Dec. 2023 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>remake of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory</a>. “Wrappin’ the cheese, wrap around me ’cause I’ve got property,” Travis raps on the track, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Genius</a>. “Chocolate AP [Audemars Piguet] and chocolate the Vs / got the Willy Wonka factory / Burn an athlete like it’s calories, find another flame hot as me, b****.”</p><h2>Timothée & Lourdes Leon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lourdes-Leon-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The actor has been in multiple high-profile relationships and dated a slew of A-listers. Even his high school girlfriend was practically Hollywood royalty. While attending LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan, aka the Fame school, Timothée and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lourdes Leon</strong></a>, 26, were “a little item.” The model, who happens to be the daughter of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madonna</strong></a>, opened up about their high school romance in an April 2021 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vanity Fair</a> interview. “I respect him a lot, we were a little item. My first boyfriend, or anything,” she recalled. The Oscar nominee also spoke about the relationship in 2017, describing a party he attended with Lourdes and her A-list mom. “That was actually a really fun night… Madonna was kinda with us dancing and my buddy Joey was there and Lola (Lourdes’ nickname) was there too,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he told&nbsp;<strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> at the time. “I usually don’t talk about this stuff, but that was a good night.”</p><h2>Timothée & Lily-Rose Depp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lily-Rose-Depp-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Fans of Timothée would recall he dated <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a>‘s daughter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lily-Rose Depp</strong></a>, 24, from late 2018 until <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they called it quits in April 2020</a>. One particular&nbsp;make out session, which was <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>caught by paparazzi in Italy</a>, essentially came to define their romance. He opened up about the “embarrassing” pictures in an October 2020 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ</a> profile. “I went to bed that night thinking that was one of the best days of my life,” he explained. “I was on this boat all day with someone I really loved, and closing my eyes, I was like, indisputably, ‘That was great.’ And then waking up to all these pictures, and feeling embarrassed, and looking like a real nob? All pale? And then people are like: This is a P.R. stunt. A P.R. stunt?! Do you think I’d want to look like that in front of all of you?!”&nbsp;GQ also reported that he was “serious about keeping his former relationship with Depp to himself.”</p><h2>Timothée & Eiza Gonzalez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eiza-Gonzalez-shutter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Timothée was linked to model-turned-actress <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Eiza González</strong></a>, 33, in the summer of 2020. The sexy couple <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>packed on the PDA</a> while vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Timothée and Eiza were photographed sharing a steamy kiss while in a hot tub on June 25, 2020, and kept the PDA going as he snuggled her and kissed her neck from behind. The&nbsp;Alita: Battle Angel actress was all smiles as she spent time with her new beau, soaking in the Mexican sunshine and the gorgeous beachfront view. The <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mexico City</a>-born actress stunned in a mustard yellow bikini, and wore her long hair down as they went for a dip. Nevertheless, pair apparently only had a summer romance, as they called it quits by the Fall.</p><h2>What Has Timothée Chalamet Said About His Sexuality?</h2><p data-injector-index=3>Timothée has not publicly spoken about his sexuality, and his breakout role was as a gay man in Call Me by Your Name.&nbsp;He starred opposite embattled actor <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Armie Hammer</a>&nbsp;</strong>in the <strong>Luca Guadagnino</strong>-directed film about a summer romance in the Italian countryside.&nbsp;In a September 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Independent</a>, the movie’s director defended his casting choice.&nbsp;“I read too much Freud to be taking seriously these kind of critics,” he said. “Meaning that I honestly don’t believe I have the right to decide whether an actor is straight or not. Who am I to know what somebody is thinking of himself or herself within themselves. Yes, Armie is a straight man with a wife and children and the same can be said of Timothée. But do I ask them to swear on their sexuality, on their identities, on their desires, before I cast them? I don’t!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OipKismJqybq%2FHmqOapZWpeqi10aWdq6GVo7FugJJybXJtYmQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftimothee-chalamet-girlfriend-4396952.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftimothee-chalamet-girlfriend-4396952.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-girlfriend-4396952.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftimothee-chalamet-girlfriend-4396952.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-girlfriend-4396952.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftimothee-chalamet-girlfriend-4396952.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./punters-stunned-comical-race-ayr-costs-them-17000.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./punters-stunned-comical-race-ayr-costs-them-17000.html>Punters left stunned at comical race as they see 17,000 go up in flames with unbelievable fi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adrian-caldwell.html>Fame | Adrian Caldwell net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adrian-caldwell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

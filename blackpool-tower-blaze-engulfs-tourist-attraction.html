Blackpool.</p><p>"Please stay away from the area.</p><p>"The drone team are in operation so please do not fly drones in the area as you may obstruct emergency operations."</p><p>But now in an updated statement, they have said: "Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service were called to Promenade, Blackpool today by concerned members of the public, due to a combination of factors that led them to believe it was a fire.</p><p>"The area where the fire was suspected is generally inaccessible, therefore access to this area is difficult.</p><p>"A specialist team from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service gained access and confirmed that there was no fire.</p><p>"This incident was supported by the National Police Air Service, who used thermal imaging which provided further assurance."</p><p>The Blackpool Tower first opened in 1894 and was at the time the tallest artificial structure in the UK and the world's tallest building.</p><p>There have been two significant fires at the tower, one in 1897 and a second in 1956.</p><p>The 19th century blaze destroyed two viewing platforms, ropes and supports for the tower.</p><p>The second was caused by a lit cigarette which wrecked the tower ballroom and the lounge, with repairs taking 18 months to complete.</p><p>And a 2018 fire saw a dozen people stuck at the top of the tower for four hours as crews raced to stop the spread of the blaze.</p><p>During WW2, it was used as a radar station to defend the North West against German aerial attacks.</p><p>It was declared a Grade 1 listed building in 1973.</p><p>An annual live episode of <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> is filmed in the tower's ballroom, while a zoo and circus have also been held there.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN

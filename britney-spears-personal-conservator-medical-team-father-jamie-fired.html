who is currently in charge of making Britney's health decisions -claims Britney's medical team also backs this motion, in what could be a definitive moment in her battle against her father.</p><p>The legal documents obtained by The Sun state Jodi has "paramount concern" for Jamie remaining on the conservatorship.</p><p>She called for Britney's choice of conservator, Jason Rubin, to take over the conservatorship which would remove Jamie from it altogether, according to the court papers.</p><p>"Ms. Montgomery also joins in the nomination of Jason Rubin ("Mr. Rubin") as Conservator of the Estate, who she recognizes and agrees is eminently qualified and who she believes understands his duties and obligations to act in the best interests of the Conservatee.</p><p>"Therefore, she also joins in the Appointment Petition, seeking to appoint Mr. Rubin as Conservator of the Estate in place and stead of Mr. Spears, and seeks from this Court the same relief prayed by Ms. Spears in the Appointment Petition," the doc reads.</p><p>The document adds: "Ms. Montgomery respectfully notes that Ms. Spears's medical team agrees that it is not in the best interest of the Conservatee for Mr. Spears to be and remain Conservator of the Estate."</p><h2>'PARAMOUNT CONCERN'</h2><p>On Monday, Britney's attorney&nbsp;<a href=#>Mathew Rosengart</a>&nbsp;filed papers that request the pop star’s father be replaced by high-profile CPA,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Rubin</a>, as conservator of her multi-million dollar estate.</p><p>The court will hear the case to replace Jamie on September 29.</p><p>A source close to the case revealed to The Sun that the “intention of hiring a third party CPA for Britney” is not just to handle her money but to “investigate her finances as well.”</p><p>"She has made millions that her&nbsp;attorney believes are unaccounted for and Britney doesn’t know where it went,” the insider claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>The informant explained: “The opposing counsels’ team hasn't answered many questions about it either.&nbsp;</p><p>“If her money was stolen or used in an unlawful manner, Jason will look into the person or persons responsible and where the money went.”</p><p>The legal expert then added that even in a conservatorship, “the conservator cannot use the conservatee's bank account like an ATM.”&nbsp;</p><p>They said: “There are a lot of protocols set in place that need to be followed.&nbsp;</p><p>“If those were not followed properly in this particular case, either by a family member or a business representative, that would be a criminal offense.”</p><h2>INVESTIGATING BRIT'S MONEY</h2><p>The source alleged that “jail time would be on the table for whoever unlawfully handled her finances.”</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">documents obtained by The Sun</a>&nbsp;which were filed on Monday, Britney, 39, and her new lawyer claim that the singer’s net worth is “shockingly low” compared to what it should be.</p><p>“Ms. Spears’s net worth is shockingly low and that, although no one knows what she would have done had she been in control of her fate and fortune, it’s hard to imagine how she would have done worse than her estranged dad,” the court papers read.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the legal docs</a>, Britney’s net worth is around $57 million - significantly lower than her musical peers who have sold even less albums or been on fewer tours than she has.&nbsp;</p><p>The documents also slam Jamie, 69, and point out his past issues handling money.</p><h2>'VENOMOUS'</h2><p>Reps for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney</a>, Jamie and Jason did not respond to The Sun’s request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, the Toxic singer SLAMMED her dad Jamie as she and her attorney filed new papers to get him officially removed from her 13-year-conservatorship.</p><p>In the documents, the mom-of-two called the relationship with her father "venomous" and said "it impairs Ms. Spears's mental health, her well-being, and her ability to pursue and continue with her extraordinary career.”</p><p>She continued slamming her dad in the docs, adding: “Since receiving professional medical care at the outset of this conservatorship over thirteen years ago, Ms. Spears is clearly in a different place now, and she has been for many years.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>“The entire world has witnessed Ms. Spears working tirelessly -- with astonishing dedication, precision, and excellence.</p><p>"As a musical artist and performer, an exceptional earner for Mr. Spears (and others) who had a financial interest in making sure she would continue to work and perform.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The docs - which asked for Jason to be appointed onto her case for the first time - also call her dad's control on her life "traumatizing, insane and depressing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000635740742-17.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000661248512-2.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Britney Spears' ex-manager Sam Lufti claims she BEGGED to be freed from conservatorship in sad 2008 phone call</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrY2yDdYORaJmroaSjsrp50qmcmqqjYr2mvtKopZqkXZi8r7%2FEq62arJ%2Bneq6xw6KamqRdqbKiuYyfmK2glad6q63MopxmnpmnsqV7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-personal-conservator-medical-team-father-jamie-fired.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbritney-spears-personal-conservator-medical-team-father-jamie-fired.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-personal-conservator-medical-team-father-jamie-fired.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbritney-spears-personal-conservator-medical-team-father-jamie-fired.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-personal-conservator-medical-team-father-jamie-fired.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-personal-conservator-medical-team-father-jamie-fired.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hugh-grant-says-wonka-director-sent-him-naked-oompa-loompa-image-exclusive-8411492.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hugh-grant-says-wonka-director-sent-him-naked-oompa-loompa-image-exclusive-8411492.html>Hugh Grant Says 'Wonka' Director Sent Him a Naked Oompa Loompa Image</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dream-home-makeover.html>'Dream Home Makeover' Latest News and Updates</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dream-home-makeover.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

May he rest in peace.”</p><p>Munster Rugby CEO, Ian Flanagan, added: “On behalf of Munster Rugby, I would like to express our deepest sympathies to Greig’s wife Fiona, son Jack, daughter Ciara, and the wider Oliver family.</p><p>“We are all in a state of shock following Greig’s tragic passing. He was a great colleague and friend to so many and will be dearly missed across the Munster and Irish Rugby community.</p><p>“Greig made his presence felt each day, he was always there to provide a helping hand and was a hugely popular character with his light-hearted nature and sense of humour.</p><p>“He had an infectious enthusiasm for the game and was incredibly passionate about helping young players be the best they can be on and off the field. May he rest in peace.”</p><h2>'INCREDIBLY PASSIONATE'</h2><p>Traditional rivals Leinster also offered their support, tweeting: "Thinking of all in Munster Rugby at this tough time who have lost a dear

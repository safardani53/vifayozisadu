<time>16 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Manchester United dominated the Premier League in the 1990s and 2000s, with a slew of long-serving players under a single manager, Sir Alex Ferguson. Sir Alex Ferguson’s players are now the most successful Premier League players.</p><p>However, everything changed in 2013. Following Sir Alex’s retirement, the club experienced numerous internal changes, and Manchester United has struggled for consistency ever since. Manchester City emerged during the same time period. Chelsea has been among the top guns since the mid-2000s and has remained there.</p><p>While the majority of players with the most Premier League titles are from Manchester United, that isn’t the case with active players right now. Because of the league’s intense competition, we don’t see a consistent favorite these days. As a result, many teams have shifted their positions in the top spot.</p><p>Except for Manchester City, no team has won consecutive Premier League titles since Manchester United in 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the active players with the most Premier League titles. Four active players have won the most Premier League titles.</p><h2>Number 4: Fernandinho -4 titles</h2><p><strong>Fernandinho,</strong> the captain of Manchester City, is the club’s longest-serving player. He is also the only remaining member of Manchester City’s famous 2013-14 Premier League-winning squad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fernandinho.jpg><p>The Brazilian will be in his ninth Premier League season at the Etihad in 2021-22. With the Sky Blues, he won four Premier League titles. Following the departure of club veteran Vincent Kompany, the team’s captaincy was handed over to David Silva.</p><p>When the latter returned to Spain, Pep Guardiola entrusted Fernandinho with the captaincy. Many questioned Pep’s decision because Fernandinho’s age was raised. Nonetheless, he proved all of his critics wrong.</p><p>The club offered the Brazilian midfielder two contract extensions after his initial contract expired.</p><p>Fernandinho’s experience and level-headedness help him maintain his place at the club, which is brimming with talented players. The 36-year-old is no longer a regular player due to injury woes.</p><p>Fernando, on the other hand, remains a well-respected player at City, having won the club’s seventh Premier League title and his first as captain last season.</p><h2>Number 3: David Silva -4 Titles</h2><p><strong>David Silva</strong> enjoyed a fair share of Premier League success before departing for La Liga. He was a key member of Manchester City’s title-winning squads in 2011-12 and 2013-14.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-Silva.jpg><p>The Spaniard won back-to-back Premier League titles in 2018 and 2019, bringing his total to four. David Silva joined the club from Valencia in 2010 and did not miss a single Premier League game until his retirement in 2020.</p><p>During Spain’s UEFA Euro 2012 victory, David Silva was the only non-La Liga player in the starting XI. David Silva has won numerous trophies during his career, but the Premier League title is his most notable achievement at the club level.</p><h2>Number 2: Luis Nani -4 Titles</h2><p><strong>Luis Nani</strong>, a Portuguese forward, spent the majority of his career at Old Trafford under Sir Alex Ferguson’s watchful eye. Nani joined Manchester United in 2007 but was unable to demonstrate his full potential to the club’s supporters due to a lack of playing time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Luis-Nani.jpg><p>He did, however, have his moments of magic, and the club was pleased with his abilities. Nani was up against compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo and other Manchester United attackers such as Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs.</p><p>The 2009 season was the time for the current MLS star to step up and take on a larger role. Following Cristiano Ronaldo’s high-profile move to Real Madrid, Luis Nani assumed responsibility for the team’s goal-scoring.</p><p>Nani stayed at Old Trafford until 2015 when he returned to his former club Sporting Lisbon. The four-time Premier League champion currently plays and captains Orlando City FC in Major League Soccer.</p><h2>Number 1: Sergio Aguero -5 titles</h2><p><strong>Sergio Aguero</strong> was the driving force behind Manchester City’s recent emergence as the Premier League’s strongest team. Aguero won five EPL trophies and played a key role in each of them during his ten years with Cityzen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Sergio-Aguero.jpg><p>After winning his fifth and Manchester City’s seventh domestic league title, Aguero left for Barcelona in 2021. Before leaving the club and the Premier League, the Argentine broke Wayne Rooney’s Premier League goal record for a single club.</p><p>Kun Aguero accomplished this feat by scoring twice after coming off the bench on his final day as a Manchester City player! He scored 260 goals in all competitions while wearing the Sky Blue jersey. As a result, he is Man City’s all-time leading scorer.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdaXqir9OirZ5loKGuurHRrGSwoaSderW0xGakqKukYr2zscyinKtlnJquqMHEZquirJyawHA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-4-active-players-with-the-most-premier-league-titles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftop-4-active-players-with-the-most-premier-league-titles.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftop-4-active-players-with-the-most-premier-league-titles.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftop-4-active-players-with-the-most-premier-league-titles.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-4-active-players-with-the-most-premier-league-titles.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-4-active-players-with-the-most-premier-league-titles.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dancing-with-the-stars-recap-who-got-booted-first.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dancing-with-the-stars-recap-who-got-booted-first.html>Dancing with the Stars Results: Who Got Booted First?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./461b833b-58b0-c857-e88f-650cdfc0a51f.html>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./461b833b-58b0-c857-e88f-650cdfc0a51f.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

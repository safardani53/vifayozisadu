He could probably cope with a nicotine patch."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Sinitta, who previously appeared on a charity special of&nbsp;Celebrity First Dates&nbsp;for Stand Up To Cancer back in 2017 – will be gracing our screens again on Celebs Go Dating in a bid to find love.</p><p>The TV star said she is ready for find her dream man, admitting she missed having a partner during the pandemic.</p><p>Speaking about her Celebs Go Dating experience, Sinitta told us: "I’m still very much in it – still filming.</p><p>"It’s bizarre, it’s fun, it’s crazy, it’s challenging.</p><p>"I’ve been single for eight years, so really out of the whole romance to be honest.</p><p>"I was happily single for about five years of it and then with the pandemic I really missed having that romantic partner.</p><p>"So it’s quite good doing the show because you don’t realise it but when you’re not interested in a relationship you kind of shut down that whole side of your personality, your character, your senses, your sensuality, so it’s quite nice doing the show again because it’s all switched on again.</p><p>"I’m literally walking down the street again noticing hot men – thinking ‘he’s attractive, he’s gorgeous’.</p><p>"Whereas I was almost kind of blind for a few years because I wasn’t interested, I wasn’t looking so I couldn’t see.</p><p>"Now I’m seeing everyone, and I have to say people are looking quite good."</p><p>So far, Sinitta has been serenaded by her dates, while others have commented on her famous leaf palm dress she wore on X Factor in 2009.</p><p>I’m literally walking down the street again noticing hot men – thinking ‘he’s attractive, he’s gorgeous'.</p><span class=quote-credit>Sinitta</span><p>Speaking about her dates, she said: "There have been a few interesting ones, I just don’t know what to do.</p><p>"I didn’t date when I was younger, I was a popstar when I was quite young, so I didn’t have that sort of luxury going out on dates and that normal thing.</p><p>"So, this is so weird to me. I don’t know how to react or act.</p><p>"I went on one date and a man sang to me really loudly, I don’t know if it was sweet, or if was funny or it was weird, I was just very uncomfortable, and people were looking.</p><p>"They do recognise me, maybe that’s what makes them want to sing. It’s really odd."</p><p>She continued: "I’m always planning a little outfit – it’s going to be hard to top the leaf outfit as everyone without fail on the dates says I hope you would have turned up in the leaf – it’s the most memorable thing I’ve ever done which is crazy because it was just a joke I was playing on Simon."</p><p>Sinitta will be joining Hollyoaks star Gary Lucy, Geordie Shore beauty Bethan Kershaw and Love Island's Laura Anderson - but there is one celebrity who Sinitta has "taken under her wing".</p><p>"We all get on well but the person I’ve taken under my wing is Navid Sole the chemist from The Apprentice, he is so cute and so funny, we’re like the little odd couple," she added.</p><p>Stoptober starts on the 1st October, encouraging thousands of smokers to make a quit attempt.</p><p>Pop 80s icon&nbsp;Sinitta&nbsp;said; “I am supporting Stoptober again this year because it’s such a great way to quit.</p><p>"Anyone looking to quit should use this month as their starting point.

Blue or pink?" they threw the darts at black balloons that a friend held on the other end of a parking lot.&nbsp;</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>When Choppa hit his balloon, it was empty, but when Da'Nae hit hers, blue smoke and glitter erupted, confirming that the couple was having a son. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the caption, the rapper also shared the name they chose for their kidâ€“Seven Da'Shun Potts.&nbsp;</p><h2>NLE Choppa's Girlfriend Marissa Da'Nae</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="follow noopener">rumors</a> of their pregnancy had started after Da'Nae posted a video with Choppa during Thanksgiving. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans noticed Da'Nae's bump and suspected that she was pregnant. The couple had kept quiet&nbsp;about it until the gender reveal video.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>NLE&nbsp;Choppa And His Pregnant Girlfriend Marissa Da'Nae (Source:&nbsp;Marissa Da'Nae's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</strong></p><p>It is unconfirmed how long <a href=# rel=follow>Choppa and his girlfriend</a> have been dating, but earlier this year in January, Choppa was trying his luck with former Disney child star Skai Jackson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, on November 20, Choppa took to Twitter and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a> his girl was "the realest."&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That same month, the rapper had posted photos from his 19th birthday celebration, and most of the pictures featured Da'Nae.</p><p>For the unversed, Choppa's girlfriend is equally famous as the rapper, and rightfully so. She is a model, business owner, and TV show star.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does she endorse different brands, but she is also the CEO of her own brands, including Brazy Collections, which she described as a Brazy but Lavish Boutique and Lavish Extensions, a company selling "Grade A HD Lace Wigs."</p><p>But she is best known for her work on the sketch comedy and improv game show&nbsp;Wild&nbsp;'N Out.</p><h2>NLE Choppa's Daughter and Baby Mama</h2><p>Before Choppa and Da'Nae got together, he was with Mariah J. Although the former couple is no longer together, their union resulted in a baby daughter named Clover, who was born on June 20, 2020.</p><p>The couple is trying to co-parent amicably, but things weren't always smooth sailing for them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to The Shade Room, Choppa wanted Mariah to terminate her pregnancy according to the text messages on her Instagram stories.&nbsp;</p><p>Burt Choppa responded to his baby mama and her antics, saying that there were two sides to the story and that fans should not believe everything so easily.</p><p>Even after their daughter was born, the two still had problems.</p><p>Choppa took to Twitter to share that he did not know his daughter's name and that Mariah had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">kept their daughter away</a> from him.</p><p>But a few weeks later, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">apologized</a>&nbsp;to his baby mama and added that they were trying to co-parent for the sake of their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKacmnqktM6pp5pll56%2FrbLRopynnF2lv6azzZqlrWaYqbqt</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnle-choppa-girlfriend-pregnant-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnle-choppa-girlfriend-pregnant-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnle-choppa-girlfriend-pregnant-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnle-choppa-girlfriend-pregnant-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnle-choppa-girlfriend-pregnant-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnle-choppa-girlfriend-pregnant-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lindsay-czarniak-bio-age-family-net-worth-husband-wedding-ig-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lindsay-czarniak-bio-age-family-net-worth-husband-wedding-ig-wiki.html>Family &amp;amp; Reporting- Players Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jessica-simpson-wears-daisy-dukes-shows-off-toned-legs-in-new-pic.html>Jessica Simpson Wears Daisy Dukes, Shows Off Toned Legs in New Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jessica-simpson-wears-daisy-dukes-shows-off-toned-legs-in-new-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

When I heard the news I was heartbroken but we’ll never be as heartbroken as the parents and families of these two young people who have been taken from us.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>NOTORIOUS ACCIDENT BLACKSPOT</h2><p>The emergency services rushed to the scene of the crash, which happened at a notorious accident blackspot.</p><p>A technical examination by Garda Forensic Collision Investigators has been ongoing all day while road diversions were put in place.</p><p>Gardai in Buncrana, who are leading the investigation, appealed to anyone who may have witnessed the crash or was in the area near the time to contact them.</p><p>A Garda spokesperson said “Any road users who were travelling on the R238 in the early hours of this morning between midnight and 1am and has camera footage including dash-cam, is asked to make this available to Gardaí.</p><p>“Anyone with any information is asked to contact Buncrana Garda Station on 074 932 0540, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111 or any Garda station.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>'DISTURBING' NUMBER OF ROAD DEATHS</h2><p>The two deceased young people were taken from the accident scene and transferred to Letterkenny General Hospital.</p><p>Their remains are expected to be released tonight as their heartbroken families make arrangements for their funerals in the coming days.</p><p>Meanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it is a matter of “enormous concern” that more people have died on Irish roads this year than did all of last year.</p><p>He said the deaths of two young people in Donegal is very much on everyone’s minds.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He saidL “We have made so much progress in the last couple of decades.</p><p>“There was a time when 600, 700 people were dying on our roads and it is really disturbing to see that number, which had come down, going back up again and it is something I will be taking a personal interest in as Taoiseach.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

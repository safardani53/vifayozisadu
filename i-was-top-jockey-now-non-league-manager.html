I drove home and the phone goes and it was these Newcastle boys wanting my address so they could shoot me and break my legs!"</p><p>Mick fortunately kept both his legs but his days in racing - and the legendary nights out - were soon to end.</p><p>He was No 1 rider for John Quinn - of Highfield Princess fame - at the time but smashed his back in a nasty fall and never fully recovered.</p><p>Mick started playing non-league in 2015 but always wanted to move into management and soon got a job as boss at Harrogate Railway FC after cutting his teeth with the first team at Darlington.</p><p>He resigned in May this year after leading them to the play-off spots two years in a row.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>There was no promotion and Mick joined Toolstation Northern Counties Eastern League premier side Tadcaster last May.</p><p>They picked up their first win of the season in the weekend just gone - and, presumably, without any gangsters watching on the touchline.</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.

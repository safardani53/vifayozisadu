I was like, 'Wow, this is insane!'</p><p>"My thing is just playing the background, but now it's like, 'No girl, you are on front street'.”</p><p>Aside from her <a href=#>social media</a> presence, Dreka is the co-founder of the Bread Winner’s Association, a record label she founded with Kevin in 2010.</p><p>They founded the label after Kevin told Dreka he wanted to pursue a musical career.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Dreka told the outlet that at the time, Kevin "was always recording, but he was just doing it in a room in his grandmother's house".</p><p>But when he said he wanted to pursue it as a profession, she did her homework.</p><p>She said: "I learned any and everything I could learn about the industry on my own because nobody is just going to say, 'Hey, come on let me show you the ropes!'"</p><p>She added: "We pretty much just made our own path."</p><h2>Are they still together?</h2><p>Speculation began to surface in March 2022 that Dreka and her <a href=#>rapper </a>husband had separated after a cryptic post on social media.</p><p>In the post, Kevin wrote, "At times, we miss our X’s but it’s in the past for a reason – do you not recall the smell, the arguments, the energy being drained, not reaching your goals, the money you could have made, the money you f**ked up, the time you should’ve invested in yourself – f**k em. #CarryOn."</p><p>It seems to become clearer in the summer of 2022 that the fans were witnessing the demise of the power couple.</p><p>On June 4, 2022, when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin posted a video</a> response to a fan who asked where Dreka was.</p><p>"Man, fall this peace and all that BS, where's Dreka? Stop playing with us," the fan wrote.</p><p>Kevin responded with: "Guess I lost a fan for making myself happy."</p><p>Following the post, Kevin was seen dining at a <a href=#>New York City</a> restaurant with Love and Hip Hop: <a href=#>Miami</a>&nbsp;star Jojo Zarur on June 7, 2022.</p><p>They were seen taking photos for fans and a video shows Kevin and Zarur embracing as they walked away from fans.</p><p>Kevin released his single, Super General, on June 9, 2022, which appears to confirm their split.</p><p>The music video shows photos of Zarur as Kevin raps: "Took the blame in interviews and made it look like I was trippin'/ Made the 'Dreka' song, lied to the world while trying to protect her image."</p><p>To the surprise of fans, Dreka did not respond to the dig and later in June the couple were seen holding hands at an airport with their children.</p><p>From there, things went on quietly until they welcomed in 2023, and were spotted being intimate and celebrating together at a <a href=#>New Years</a> party.</p><p>Her Instagram still remains as Dreka Gates.</p><h2>Do Kevin and Dreka have children?</h2><p>Kevin and Dreka have two children together - a daughter called Islah Koren, born on November 30, 2012, and their son, Khaza Kamil, born on May 10, 2014.</p><p>The couple had both children before they were married and since then, they have kept their children's lives out of the spotlight.</p><p>Dreka had a home birth for both her children which they associate with their decision to not vaccinate their children.</p><p>Kevin told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>: "I don't believe in conspiracy theories."</p><p>Speaking out on his beliefs, Kevin said, "A lot of children that were born in a hospital experienced a lot of difficulty that they didn’t have to experience."</p><p>Dreka said her decision not to vaccinate their children was in line with Kevin's, but having a waterbirth for their children is something that she said stemmed from a near-death experience she once had in the hospital.</p><p>Dreka told The Source: "I had an incident in the hospital a few years ago where I almost died being under the care of hospital doctors.</p><p>"That was my main motivation."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She added: "Plus, I'm really big on all-natural things. Both of my kids were born in the water.</p><p>"It's the greatest experience in life, love.

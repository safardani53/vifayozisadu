While the former pastor has previously admitted that his life has been a "challenging road" amid his various <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>controversies with the church</a>, he revealed that his family has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>"together"</a> despite it all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Premiering May 19, FX's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">The Secrets of Hillsong</a> chronicles the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>scandals of the megachurch</a>, featuring the couple's first interviews together since they were forced out of Hillsong in November 2020 for Carl's "moral failures," with the former pastor later <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>admitting to infidelity</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the four-part documentary series, Carl — once a "rockstar pastor" known for his close relationship with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Justin Bieber</a> among other A-list celebrities — opens up about his cheating scandal with Laura, a "breach of trust" that he says was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>"one of the biggest [mistakes] of my life."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of its release, Carl wrote an in-depth <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a> about his sobriety, marriage and the FX series — and shared he'd recently celebrated his 20th wedding anniversary with Laura. "For the last 3 years my entire focus has been fighting for my wife and my kids," he wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All I wanted was to prove to my wife and kids that I could show up for them like I had never done before," the post continued in part.

In the early oughts, he moved to Australia to study at Hillsong International Leadership College, the church's training program, where he met Laura.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple wed on May 5, 2003, and have been together for two decades, celebrating 20 years of marriage in 2023. While the former pastor recently took time to acknowledge the "healing" from his "mistakes," Laura <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up at length</a> on the topic in a May 2021 post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Marking the pair's 18th wedding anniversary, Laura spoke out on Instagram for the first time since her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>husband's cheating scandal</a> made headlines in November 2020. While the caption did not explicitly reference Carl's scandal, it made multiple allusions to familial strife and resilience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She compared her life to palm trees, noting that "they are strong, can weather the biggest storms, they always grow upwards," followed by listing a few words: "freedom, righteousness, reward, resurrection."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, the mother of three explained that she took a break from social media over the past few months because it was "not good for [her] soul," and that she'd had to block and delete many users and comments from her posts.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Carl and Laura Lentz.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Laura Lentz/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Laura added that her family's struggles led her to "true friendships," but also marked the end of others. Since then, Laura — who also appears in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">The Secrets of Hillsong</a> — has opened up about her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>growth and healing journey</a> on social media, revealing that she "wouldn't wish my journey on my worst enemy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she wrote</a> that she'd rather use her story "to help someone else" despite "the trauma, the thoughts and memories" she felt "everyday." "We all have scars from many of life's experiences, and i am choosing to see mine as "BEAUTIFUL," she concluded the post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple's "first interview" featured in FX's documentary uncovers new relationship bombshells, including Laura revealing she "freaked out" after finding her husband and their nanny in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>"compromising position."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple — who were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>both pushed out</a> of Hillsong Church in 2020 — ultimately stayed together and worked through the fallout of Carl's betrayal.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ava-lentz></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ava Lentz</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Laura Lentz/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ava Lentz (pictured right) is the eldest of Carl and Laura's three kids born on June 1, 2004.

He went on to praise her leadership qualities, discuss the stereotypical dad concerns he has with her dating life and acknowledge her transition into a young adult.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"TIME. FLIES!!" Lentz wrote. "I used to say the typical young dad things we all tend to say about our daughters.. 'I'm gonna keep her in the house... she will never date...'" he continued in part. "But then, you begin to see a woman of God develop and mature and you realize that she's a LEADER."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carl Lentz/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She can and will make her own good decisions.

"She has taught me," Carl wrote before listing "one lesson in particular that some other dads might find helpful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The lesson? "She requires TIME," he explained. "There have been times we have hung out for an hour or two, she wont say much. And then out of nowhere, comes deep thought, interesting questions, passionate feelings."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carl concluded of Charlie: "Your bright spirit and kind heart inspires me daily."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for Laura, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she shared</a> that her daughter is "kind, fun, strong, loving, compassionate, hilarious and not afraid to stand alone!

As for his personality, Laura said that he is "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>kind, sensitive, protective, self aware & a lover of people</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carl also posts a lot about their father-son bonding time, especially as a working dad.

My daughters can barely fit me in," he wrote on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> in July 2019.

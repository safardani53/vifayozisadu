The Notre Dame quarterback has been rocking a beard since his days at Wake Forest, and it has become one of the definitive aspects of his look.</p><p>That's why so many football fans were deeply alarmed by the revelation that Sam had shaved his beard off in favor of a mustache. In a tweet from Notre Dame on Oct. 18, 2023, Sam shows off the new look (and looks basically unrecognizable). The video featuring Sam's mustache was captioned "Stache Steez," and now everyone wants to know what prompted Sam to shave.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Sam Hartman shave his beard?</h2><p>Sam hasn't offered any sort of explanation for his decision to shave his beard in favor of a 'stache, and many are confused in part because it's not even November yet. He might have been looking for a change of pace, decided the beard was too itchy or sweaty, or just decided to shave it for no reason at all. Whatever his reasons were, fans are now going to have to get used to his new mustachio'd appearance.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sam does have a brand partnership with Dollar Shave Club, but that partnership predates his decision to shave. In fact, he was posting videos of himself grooming his beard with their products weeks before he decided to go in for a more full-throated shave. The good news is that, if you miss the beard, Sam can likely grow it back fairly quickly if that's something he decides he wants to do.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The reactions to Sam shaving his beard were mixed.</h2><p>While some people were sad to see the beard go, others were more complimentary about Sam's new look, saying that he's probably the best looking quarterback in football no matter how much hair he has on his face.</p><p>"Iâ€™m usually not fond of those staches, but he is so fine with it," one person wrote.</p><p>"Hmmmm. Maybe prepping for No Shave November? Hope so. Bring back the beard," another person added.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Ultimately, Sam's facial hair shouldn't have a major role in determining how he performs on the field, but it's certainly nice for fans to have something else to focus on. Sam has been playing well this year, and Notre Dame is currently sitting at a solid 6-2 record. Sam may be one of many quarterbacks up in this year's draft class. If Sam is in the draft class, he'll be sought after by a number of teams for his skill with the ball, and his great looks won't hurt either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2arkaJ6qa3RraSapl2otaLCxGafoqtdl7KivsM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-sam-hartman-shave-his-beard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-sam-hartman-shave-his-beard.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-sam-hartman-shave-his-beard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-sam-hartman-shave-his-beard.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-sam-hartman-shave-his-beard.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-sam-hartman-shave-his-beard.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brent-faiyaz-tour-tickets.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brent-faiyaz-tour-tickets.html>Brent Faiyaz tour 2023: How can I get tickets?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-says-finn-wolfhard-is-a-lousy-kisser.html>Stranger Things Millie Bobby Brown Says Finn Wolfhard Is a Lousy Kisser</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-says-finn-wolfhard-is-a-lousy-kisser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

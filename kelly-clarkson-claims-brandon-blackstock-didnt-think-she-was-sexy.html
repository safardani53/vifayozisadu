Blackstock has not publicly addressed Clarkson’s claims. <i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out for comment.</p><p class=p1>Clarkson further alleged in her court filing that Blackstock told her that NBC wanted to “have someone that was Black” on the judging panel, claiming that the former <i>American Idol </i>champ was “too similar” to another coach on the series. (Blackstock allegedly compared Clarkson’s career to <i>The Voice </i>alum <strong>Blake Shelton</strong>, who is another one of Blackstock’s music clients.)</p><p class=p1>“Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays,” Clarkson reportedly told her attorney, <strong>Ed McPherson</strong>, in the docs about how she remembered the accusations years later.</p><p class=p1>Per Clarkson, Blackstock allegedly got NBC to change their tune and hire her after he claimed that<a href=#> she would join rival show</a> <i>American Idol </i>(on ABC) if they did not.</p><p class=p1>Clarkson joined <i>The Voice </i>in 2018’s season 14, which she ultimately won alongside contestant <strong>Brynn Cartell</strong>i. Clarkson has since won <i>The Voice </i>three more times during her coaching tenure.</p><p class=p1>In November 2023, a California labor commission ruled that <a href=#>Blackstock owes Clarkson</a> more than $2.6 million in unpaid commission. According to the prior court docs, Blackstock secured Clarkson several deals, including a coaching seat on <i>The Voice</i>, despite that not being a job responsibility of a music manager. He reportedly collected a booking fee, which allegedly totaled more than Clarkson’s earned salary.</p><p class=p1>Clarkson married Blackstock in 2013, shortly before they welcomed daughter River Rose, now 9, and son Remington, now 7. After seven years of marriage, <i>Us </i>confirmed in June 2020 that Clarkson had filed for divorce. Months later, Brandon’s father,<strong> Narvel Blackstock</strong>, and his Starstruck Management Group sued Clarkson for breach of contract and alleged that she owed them $1.4 million in unpaid commissions, in addition to the $1.9 million she already paid the firm. Clarkson subsequently filed a countersuit for violations to California Labor Code.</p><p class=p1>After a messy legal back-and-forth, Clarkson and Brandon <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> two years later. Clarkson was <a href=#>granted primary custody</a> of River Rose and Remington, as well as ownership of her Montana property where Brandon had been living. She also agreed to pay Brandon a one-time sum of $1.3 million and $115,000 in monthly spousal support until January.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Kelly is feeling relieved that her spousal support to Brandon has come to an end,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told </a><i><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> </i>earlier this month. “She’s been ready for this for a while now and is so happy her payments to Brandon will be complete. It’s so nice knowing that this chapter of her life can close with the new year.”</p><p class=p1>Clarkson and her two children have since relocated to New York City, where her <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show </i>is currently filming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaknZyhxm6vy5qppKufo3qkuMCipKxlkqeur7DOp2SbpJGYuLTAzpyiZpyZmbu1edOhoKejXai1pnnWmqpmq5WtxnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkelly-clarkson-claims-brandon-blackstock-didnt-think-she-was-sexy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkelly-clarkson-claims-brandon-blackstock-didnt-think-she-was-sexy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-claims-brandon-blackstock-didnt-think-she-was-sexy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkelly-clarkson-claims-brandon-blackstock-didnt-think-she-was-sexy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-claims-brandon-blackstock-didnt-think-she-was-sexy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-claims-brandon-blackstock-didnt-think-she-was-sexy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-bill-oneill-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-bill-oneill-dating.html>Who is Bill O'Neill Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kelly-brown-leaves-molly-hopkins-departs-from-90-day-the-last-resort.html>Kelly Brown Leaves Molly Hopkins, Departs from 90 Day The Last Resort</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kelly-brown-leaves-molly-hopkins-departs-from-90-day-the-last-resort.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
